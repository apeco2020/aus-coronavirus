abstract = {There was a single breeding season in autumn in which most females (including 80{\%} of 1-yr-olds) participated. Ranges of adults were up to 1 km long. Some immature males dispersed up to 10 km. Capture rates in live-traps were highest in beech/podocarp forest at 455-460 m a.s.l. and declined with altitude. No possums were caught above the treeline (1400 m a.s.l.). Removal of possums by poisoning on a 500 X 500 m grid yielded a density estimate of 0.46/ha in mixed beech forest at 460-650 m a.s.l.-from Authors},

abstract = {Eradications of invasive alien species $\backslash$nhave generally benefited biodiversity. However, $\backslash$nwithout sufficient planning, successful eradications $\backslash$ncan have unexpected and unwanted consequences for $\backslash$nnative species and ecosystems. In particular, the $\backslash$n‘‘surprise effect'' is the rapid increase of hitherto $\backslash$nunnoticed species following the sudden removal of an $\backslash$ninvasive alien that was exerting an ecological force $\backslash$non those species (predation, competition or herbivory, $\backslash$nfor example). The only way to prevent these undesired $\backslash$noutcomes is to adapt the control programme $\backslash$nfollowing the characterization of the trophic relationships $\backslash$nbetween the invasive alien species and the $\backslash$ninvaded communities, that is, to view the control with $\backslash$na holistic perspective. Here, we illustrate this point $\backslash$nwith the study of the role of the ship rat (Rattus $\backslash$nrattus), which invaded a tropical pacific atoll, $\backslash$nSurprise Island, New Caledonia. We assessed the $\backslash$nrisk of surprise effects during a pre-eradication phase $\backslash$nof several years, and then adapted our eradication $\backslash$nstrategy accordingly.},

@article{kinnear2016,
abstract = {For many years, managing rock-wallaby colonies (Petrogale lateralis lateralis) in the Western Australian Wheatbelt seemed to be a matter of routinely exposing foxes (Vulpes vulpes) to toxic baits (sodium fluoroacetate, 1080 {\textregistered}) laid around their rocky outcrops. Recent research has revealed that 1080 baitings are no longer a viable management option. Baiting is flawed over the long term because it does not erase the wallabies' pervasive fear of being depredated by foxes, which can still make their menacing presence felt before succumbing to poison bait. Accordingly, a 'landscape of fear' exists on all rock-wallaby sites, creating a 'virtual boundary' beyond which they fear to forage. Severe overgrazing occurs, ultimately causing population crashes, leaving behind devastated outcrops greatly diminished in carrying capacity. The fallout from this scenario produces a management conundrum. Rock-wallaby populations are unstable in the absence of fox control, and conversely, they are also unstable under long-term fox control. Management is now left with few options, and the future of the colonies remains open. Other conundrums involving bait interference and mesopredator release are described. An alternative to 1080 baiting is clearly needed. Recent developments in gene engineering (CRISPR technology) offer a solution in the foreseeable future.},

@article{fritts1998,
abstract = {The accidental introduction of the brown treesnake (Boiga irregularis) on Guam around 1950 induced a cascade of extirpations that may be unprecedented among historical extinction events in taxonomic scope and severity. Birds, bats, and reptiles were affected, and by 1990 most forested areas on Guam retained only three native vertebrates, all of which were small lizards. Of the hypotheses to account for the severity of this extinction event, we find some support for the importance of lack of coevolution between introduced predator and prey, avail- ability of alternate prey, extraordinary predatory capabilities of the snake, and vulnerabilities of the Guam ecosystem. In addition, there were important interac- tions among these factors, especially the presence of introduced prey (possessing coevolutionary experience) that were thus able to maintain their populations and provide alternate prey to the introduced predator while it was driving the native prey species to extinction. This complex of vulnerabilities is common on oceanic islands.},

@article{doherty2017,
abstract = {Invasive mammalian predators are major drivers of species extinctions globally. To protect native prey, lethal control is often used with the aim of reducing or exterminating invasive predator populations. The efficacy of this practice, however, is often not considered despite multiple practical and ecological factors that can limit success. Here, we summarize contemporary knowledge regarding the use and challenges of both lethal control and alternative approaches for reducing invasive predator impacts. As the prevailing management approach, we outline four key issues that can compromise the effectiveness of lethal control: release of herbivore and mesopredator populations, disruption of predator social systems, compensatory predator immigration, and ethical concerns. We then discuss the relative merits and limitations of four alternative approaches that may enhance conservation practitioner's ability to effectively manage invasive predators: top-predator conservation or reintroduction, maintaining habitat complexity, exclusion fencing, and behavioral and evolutionary ecology. Considerable uncertainty remains regarding the effectiveness of management approaches in different environmental contexts. We propose that the deficiencies and uncertainties outlined here can be addressed through a combination of adaptive management, expert elicitation, and cost-benefit analyses. Improved management of invasive predators requires greater consideration and assessment of the full range of management approaches available.},

Our goal is to prompt a more critical synthesis and evaluation of the available data, and to suggest ways to take a more scientific, evidence-based approach to understanding the impact of invasive species on extinctions. Greater clarity in our understanding of these patterns will help us to focus on the most effective ways to reduce or mitigate extinction threats from invasive species. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {We present two statistical models documenting variations in density indices of stoats and of mice in New Zealand southern beech (Nothofagus spp.) forests. They confirm previous, simpler correlations showing that the summer capture rate of stoats increases with spring mouse density index up to about 20-25 mouse captures per 100 trap-nights (C/100TN). However, at much higher mouse densities (60-80C/100TN), observed in the Grebe and Borland Valleys in southern Fiordland in 1979/80 and again in 1999/2000, fewer stoats were caught than expected. These models quantify a serious decline in capture rate of stoats during periods of high mouse abundance over the range 25-80C/100TN. At such times, management strategies aiming to protect threatened birds by intensive lethal trapping of stoats during the nesting seasons may be least effective just when they are most needed.},

	abstract = {Three male and two female ship rats (Rattus rattus) were radio-tagged and tracked in beech (Nothofagus) forest in the Eglinton Valley, Fiordland, New Zealand over two field periods in 1996 and 2000. The home range of each animal was calculated using the minimum convex polygon method. Ranges of three male rats were 7.5, 9.1, and 11.4 ha whereas those of the female rats were 0.89 and 0.27 ha. The home ranges recorded for male rats were considerably larger than those reported from other studies in non-beech forest. Ship rats are important predators of forest birds, and home range information could be used to provide a guide for trap or bait station spacing in beech forests.

State-space models are partitioned into an underlying system process describing the transitions of the true states of the system over time and the observation process linking the observations of the system to the true states. Open population capture–recapture–recovery data can be modelled in this framework by regarding the system process as the state of each individual observed within the study in terms of being alive or dead, and the observation process the recapture and/or recovery pro- cess. The traditional observation error of a state-space model is incorporated via the recapture/recovery probabilities being less than unity. The models can be fitted using a Bayesian data augmentation approach and in standard BUGS packages. Applying this state-space framework to such data permits additional complexities including individual het- erogeneity to be fitted to the data at very little additional programming effort. We consider the efficiency of the state-space model fitting approach by considering a random effects model for capture–recapture data relating to dippers and compare different Bayesian model-fitting algorithms within WinBUGS.},

The models are based on regression relationships at different levels, with the first level corresponding to the individual data and subsequent levels corresponding to between-group regressions of individual predictor effects on grouping unit variables. We present an approach to defining R2 at each level of the multilevel model, rather than attempting to create a single summary measure of fit.

In order to develop management plans for those beech forests there is a need to refine our knowledge on tree growth rates and to take account of tree size, local competition and regional differences. In this article, we use a large dataset on tree growth in unmanaged forests throughout New Zealand to develop size-specific growth models for the four beech species. In particular, we model both normal ("average") and above-average ("rapid") diameter growth rates. We found that average tree diameter growth rates were typically between 1 and 3 mm/yr and rapid tree diameter growth rates ranged between 1 and 5 mm/yr. For stems under 500 mm diameter at breast height, hard and red beech typically grew faster than black-mountain and silver beech. However, for larger trees, the fastest rates were found in black-mountain beech in Southland and silver beech in Nelson-Marlborough. Growth rates of ≤ 10 mm/yr were extremely rare in our dataset and accounted for {\textless}0.2\% of all trees (27 out of 17,781 trees). Data from thinning trials show that beech trees can achieve growth rates in excess of 6 mm/yr, making a compelling case for further stand thinning to enhance the generally slow growth rates of beech in unmanaged forests.},

However, the physiological mechanisms that mediate masting events and link them to weather and plant resources are still debated. Here, we explore how masting is affected by plant resource budgets, fruit maturation success, and hormonal coordination of cues including weather and resources. There is little empirical support for the commonly stated hypothesis that plants store carbohydrates over several years to expend in a high-seed year. Plants can switch carbohydrates away from growth in high-seed years, and seed crops are more probably limited by nitrogen or phosphorus. Resources are clearly involved in the proximate mechanisms driving masting, but resource budget (RB) models cannot create masting in the absence of selection because some underlying selective benefit is required to set the level of a ‘full’ seed crop at greater than the annual resource increment. Economies of scale (EOSs) provide the ultimate factor selecting for masting, but EOSs probably always interact with resources, which modify the relationship between weather cues and reproduction. Thus, RB and EOS models are not alternative explanations for masting – both are required. Experiments manipulating processes that affect mast seeding will help clarify the physiological mechanisms that underlie mast seeding.},

	abstract = {State-space models (SSMs) are increasingly used in ecology to model time-series such as animal movement paths and population dynamics. This type of hierarchical model is often structured to account for two levels of variability: biological stochasticity and measurement error. SSMs are flexible. They can model linear and nonlinear processes using a variety of statistical distributions. Recent ecological SSMs are often complex, with a large number of parameters to estimate. Through a simulation study, we show that even simple linear Gaussian SSMs can suffer from parameter- and state-estimation problems. We demonstrate that these problems occur primarily when measurement error is larger than biological stochasticity, the condition that often drives ecologists to use SSMs. Using an animal movement example, we show how these estimation problems can affect ecological inference. Biased parameter estimates of a SSM describing the movement of polar bears ({\textbackslash}textit\{Ursus maritimus\}) result in overestimating their energy expenditure. We suggest potential solutions, but show that it often remains difficult to estimate parameters. While SSMs are powerful tools, they can give misleading results and we urge ecologists to assess whether the parameters can be estimated accurately before drawing ecological conclusions from their results.},

	abstract = {The introduction of some animal and plant pest species in New Zealand has facilitated the establishment and success of other introduced pest species. Classic examples include rodents and rabbits, which have provided prey for a number of introduced mammalian predator species. Control of these introduced predators in New Zealand has historically focussed on removing them directly by lethal means. This approach suffers from density-dependent population responses that accelerate population recovery at low population densities. I suggest adopting an ecologically-based approach to pest control that breaks the interactive linkages between invasive mammalian pests at high trophic levels and the other introduced species that they rely on as their primary food resource. Some of these primary food species are, in turn, affected by land management practices and land-use policy. Removing the primary food resource for introduced pests at high trophic levels should, in theory, weaken the density-dependent responses that reduce the impact of lethal control. This 'bottom-up' form of pest control has the added advantage of reducing pest impacts at lower trophic levels. A greater emphasis on bottom-up pest management that targets lower trophic levels could greatly enhance current tactical approaches that focus directly on pests at higher trophic levels. Examples of where this approach could assist management of introduced pests in New Zealand and overseas are discussed.},

When they coexist with other predators, invasive rats may also generate indirect interactions via the changes they impose on the structure of communities and trophic interactions following invasion ('hyperpredation process'), or when apex predators are eradicated from the ecosystem ('mesopredator release effect'). Understanding these effects is necessary to implement restoration operations that actually benefit threatened seabird populations. We investigated these processes on two French tropical seabird islands of the western Indian Ocean, Europa and Juan de Nova, where black rats coexist with two different apex predator species (introduced cats and potentially native barn owls). The parallel use of several methods (diet analysis, stable isotopes, seabird monitoring) to identify trophic roles of rats revealed that the direct impact of rats on seabirds was particularly high on Europa where only rats and owls occur, with high consumption of chicks resulting in low breeding success for several seabird species. We also suggested that hyperpredation associated with top-down regulation of cats is occurring on Juan de Nova, although territoriality of cats may buffer this process. Conversely we found evidence that mesopredator release effect is unlikely, irrespective of the apex predator identity. Considering the most likely effects on both islands we provided recommendations on eradication priorities to mitigate the risk of local extinction that seabirds are currently facing.},

	doi = {10.1071/WR9950089},
	abstract = {Fluctuating populations of small mammals provide an excellent opportunity to study the functional and numerical responses of predators because of the wide range in prey density that occurs. I reinterpret data from six studies that have examined the role of predation in the population dynamics of votes in California, southern Sweden and western Finland, of snowshoe hares in northern Canada, and of house mice and rabbits in Australia. Most studies have measured functional responses by relying on changes in diet as reflected by seat or stomach contents. These methods are probably biased toward showing predator satiation. Contrary to previous conclusions I find that there is little evidence for non-linear (Type III) functional-response curves or predator satiation at high prey densities. Recent studies indicate that the functional and numerical responses of predators can be rapid and strong enough to initiate cyclic declines, dampen fluctuations, or even cause stable numbers. The exception to this appears to be the irruptions of mice and rabbits in Australia. I propose a general explanation for the role of predation whereby the effect of predation is largely dependent on the entire prey community. When potentially cyclic prey are a small component of the overall prey biomass, generalist predators are able to prevent fluctuations by strong functional or numerical responses. As the prey community becomes dominated by a few species that fluctuate, limit cycles predominate. Limit cycles turn into irruptive population dynamics when seasonal prey reproduction is eliminated because of extended periods of vegetation growth (vegetation flushes following drought).

	abstract = {Richard Levins has advocated the scientific merits of qualitative model- ing throughout his career. He believed an excessive and uncritical focus on emu- lating the models used by physicists and maximizing quantitative precision was hindering biological theorizing in particular. Greater emphasis on qualitative properties of modeled systems would help counteract this tendency, and Levins subsequently developed one method of qualitative modeling, loop analysis, to study a wide variety of biological phenomena. Qualitative modeling has been criticized for being conceptually and methodologically problematic. As a clear example of a qualitative modeling method, loop analysis shows this criticism is indefensible. The method has, however, some serious limitations. This paper describes loop analysis, its limitations, and attempts to clarify the differences between quantitative and qualitative modeling, in content and objective. Loop analysis is but one of numerous types of qualitative analysis, so its limitations do not detract from the currently underappreciated and underdeveloped role qualitative modeling could have within science.},

	volume = {2},
	abstract = {The distribution of native, chaparral-requiring bird species was determined for 37 isolated fragments of canyon habitat ranging in size from 0.4 to 104 hectares in coastal, urban San Diego County, California The area of chaparral habitat and canyon age (time since isolation of the habitat fragment) explains most of the variation in the number of chaparral-requiring bird species. In addition, the distribution of native predators may influence species num- ber. There is statistical evidence that coyotes control the pop- ulations of smaller predators such as foxes and domestic cats. The absence of coyotes may lead to higher levels of predation by a process of mesopredator release. The distance of canyons from other patches of chaparral habitat does not add significantly to the explained variance in chaparral- requiring species number-probably because of the virtual inability of most chaparral-requiring species to disperse through developed areas and nonscrub habitats. These re- sults and other lines of evidence suggest that chaparral- requiring birds in isolated canyons have very high rates of extinction, in part because of their low vagility. The best predictors of vulnerability of the individual species are their abundances (densities) in undisturbed habitat and their body sizes; together these two variables account for 95 per- cent of the variation in canyon occupancy. A hypothesis is proposed to account for the similarity between the steep slopes of species-area curves for chaparral-requiring birds and the slopes for some forest birds on small islands or in habitat fragments. The provision of corridors appears to be the most effective design and planning featuref or preventing the elimination of chaparral-requiring species in a fragmented landscape.},

However, control may be required only in years when stoat (Mustela erminea) densities are high. To manage local stoat populations effectively, a reliable predictor of high risk years is required. We examined whether different levels of beech seedfall and mouse capture rates were related to the levels of mohua predation recorded in the Hawdon Valley, Arthur's Pass National Park, and the Eglinton Valley, Fiordland National Park, between 1989 and 1994. During this period there was only one full beech mast year in each study area during autumn. The full mast seedfall in Hawdon Valley was predominantly of mountain beech (Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortioides) and red beech (N. fusca), and in Eglinton Valley it was predominantly silver beech (N. menziesii). During the following summer, mouse and stoat densities, and the predation rate of adult mohua, all increased considerably. There was very little predation on adult mohua in the summers following poor seedfalls when mouse and predator densities remained low. In 1993, a partial mast did not trigger a mouse or stoat irruption. We conclude that counts of beech seedfall and indices of mouse density are potential predictors of an impending irruption of key predators. Winter mouse density appeared to be the most reliable indicator, because neither stoats nor mice respond to seedfall alone. A combination of these indicators could be used as a basis for management decisions on whether to undertake stoat control to protect mohua populations in the future. However, more information is required on the seedfall thresholds that may trigger sufficient increases in mouse and stoat numbers and, consequently, bird predation},

The predominant genome is Mus musculus domesticus (from western Europe), but Mus musculus musculus (from central Europe) and Mus musculus castaneus (from southern Asia) are also represented genetically. These subspecies have hybridized to produce combinations of musculus and domesticus nuclear DNA coupled with domesticus mtDNA, and castaneus or musculus mtDNA with domesticus nuclear DNA. The majority of the mice with domesticus mtDNA that we sampled had D-loop sequences identical to two haplotypes common in Britain. This is consistent with long-term British-New Zealand cultural linkages. The origins of the castaneus mtDNA sequences widespread in New Zealand are less easy to identify.},

	abstract = {Integrated population models (IPMs) constitute a relatively new approach for estimating population trends and demographic parameters that makes use of multiple, independent data sources (e.g., count and mark-recapture data) within a unified statistical framework. In principle, IPMs offer several advantages over more conventional modeling approaches that rely on a single source of data, including greater precision in parameter estimates and the ability to estimate demographic parameters for which no explicit data are available. However, to date, the IPM literature has focused primarily on model development and evaluation, and few "real-world" applications have demonstrated that IPMs can strengthen inferences about population dynamics in a species of conservation concern. Here, we combined 23 years of count, occupancy, reproductive, and mark-recapture data into an IPM framework to estimate population trends and demographic rates in a population of California spotted owls (Strix occidentalis occidentalis). Using this framework, we observed a significant population decline, as evidenced by the geometric mean of the finite annual rate of population change (??t-??=0.969, 95\% CRI 0.957-0.980) and the resulting realized population change (proportion of the initial population present in 2012; ????2012=0.501, 95\% CRI 0.383-0.641). The estimated decline was considerably greater than the approximately 30\% decline estimated using conventional mark-recapture and occupancy approaches (Tempel and Guti??rrez, 2013). The IPM likely yielded a greater decline because it allowed for the inclusion of three years of data from the beginning of the study that were omitted from previous analyses to meet the assumptions of mark-recapture models. The IPM may also have yielded a greater estimate of decline than occupancy models owing to an increase in the number of territories occupied by single owls over the study period. All demographic parameters (adult and juvenile apparent survival, reproductive rate, immigration rate) were positively correlated with ??t??, but immigration was fairly high (immt??=0.097, 95\% CRI 0.055-0.140) and contributed most to temporal variation in ??t??, suggesting that changes in owl abundance were influenced by processes occurring outside of our study area. More broadly, our results indicated that the IPM framework has the potential to strengthen inference in population monitoring and demographic studies, particularly for those involving long-lived species whose abundance may be slowly declining. In our case, the conservation implications from the results of the IPM suggested a decline in the population of owls that was steeper than previously thought. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

However, the complexity of many ecosystems presents a challenge to analysis, especially if reliant on quantification because of the onerous task of precisely measuring or estimating numerous parameters. We present qualitative modelling as a complementary approach to quantitative methods. Qualitative modelling clarifies how community structure alone affects dynamics, here of exploited populations. We build an array of models that describe different ecosystems with different harvesting practices, and analyse them to predict responses to various perturbations. This approach demonstrates the utility of qualitative modelling as a means to identify and interpret community-level indicators for systems that are at or near equilibrium, and for those that are frequently perturbed away from equilibrium. Examining the interaction of ecological and socio-economic variables associated with commercial fisheries provides an understanding of the main feedbacks that drive and regulate exploited ecosystems. The method is particularly useful for systems where the basic relationships between variables are understood but where precise or detailed data are lacking.},

	abstract = {The mohua or yellowhead (Mohoua ochrocephala) is an endangered, hole-nesting forest bird endemic to New Zealand. Mohua suffer periodic population crashes due to severe predation by the introduced stoat (Mustela erminea). In 1990, a stoat population irruption provided an opportunity to reassess the impact of stoat predation on mohua and to test two linked hypotheses: that adaquate control of stoats by trapping is possible, and that it is a viable management option to assist mohua recovery. The primary experiment (summer 1990/91) was repeated in the summers of 1991/92 and 1992/93 when stoat numbers were lower. Mohua productivity and adult female mortality were compared in two study areas, one trapped and one untrapped, in the Eglinton Valley, Fiordland. Sixty-two stoats were caught in the 50 ha trapped area during summer 1990/91. The fledging of many first clutches, and the laying of second clutches, coincided closely with the period when high numbers of stoats were being caught in traps. Eighty percent of the nests in the trapped area fledged young, compared with only 36\% in the untrapped area. Pairs produced nearly twice as many young in the trapped area. A higher proportion of breeding females disappeared from the untrapped area. In the two subsequent summers, 29 and 14 stoats were caught, and breeding success was higher than previously recorded in both trapped and untrapped areas. We suggest that trapping in the year following a stoat irruption may also be warranted.},

	abstract = {Top-predators have been reported to have an important role in structuring food webs and maintaining ecological processes for the benefit of biodiversity at lower trophic levels. This is thought to be achieved through their suppressive effects on sympatric mesopredators and prey. Great scientific and public interest surrounds the potential use of top-predators as biodiversity conservation tools, and it can often be difficult to separate what we think we know and what we really know about their ecological utility. Not all the claims made about the ecological roles of top-predators can be substantiated by current evidence. We review the methodology underpinning empirical data on the ecological roles of Australian dingoes (Canis lupus dingo and hybrids) to provide a comprehensive and objective benchmark for knowledge of the ecological roles of Australia's largest terrestrial predator. From a wide variety of methodological flaws, sampling bias, and experimental design constraints inherent to 38 of the 40 field studies we assessed, we demonstrate that there is presently unreliable and inconclusive evidence for dingoes' role as a biodiversity regulator. We also discuss the widespread (both taxonomically and geographically) and direct negative effects of dingoes to native fauna, and the few robust studies investigating their positive roles. In light of the highly variable and context-specific impacts of dingoes on faunal biodiversity and the inconclusive state of the literature, we strongly caution against the positive management of dingoes in the absence of a supporting evidence-base for such action. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Introduced stoats (Mustela erminea) are important invasive predators in southern beech (Nothofagus sp.) forests in New Zealand. In these forests, one of their primary prey species - introduced house mice (Mus musculus), fluctuate dramatically between years, driven by the irregular heavy seed-fall (masting) of the beech trees. We examined the effects of mice on stoats in this system by comparing the weights, age structure and population densities of stoats caught on two large islands in Fiordland, New Zealand - one that has mice (Resolution Island) and one that does not (Secretary Island). On Resolution Island, the stoat population showed a history of recruitment spikes and troughs linked to beech masting, whereas the Secretary Island population had more constant recruitment, indicating that rodents are probably the primary cause for the boom and bust' population cycle of stoats in beech forests. Resolutions Island stoats were 10\% heavier on average than Secretary Island stoats, supporting the hypothesis that the availability of larger prey (mice verses wet) leads to larger stoats. Beech masting years on this island were also correlated with a higher weight for stoats born in the year of the masting event. The detailed demographic information on the stoat populations of these two islands supports previously suggested interactions among mice, stoats and beech masting. These interactions may have important consequences for the endemic species that interact with fluctuating populations of mice and stoats.},

By contrast, interguild relationships between introduced mustelids and rodents can have very different consequences for native birds in ecosystems where mustelids have been introduced. Here, we consider the interactions between Stoats Mustela erminea, feral House Mice Mus musculus and native birds in New Zealand beech Nothofagus spp. forests. We conclude that buffering to protect birds from Stoat predation normally fails in these systems, because peak populations of mice in these forests are low by Holarctic standards, and mice usually do not become sufficiently abundant to distract increased numbers of Stoats from preying on birds. However, temporary buffering is possible during rare episodes of extreme mouse abundance.},

	abstract = {Hurlbert divides experimental ecologist into 'those who do not see any need for dispersion (of replicated treatments and controls), and those who do recognize its importance and take whatever measures are necessary to achieve a good dose of it'. Experimental ecologists could also be divided into those who do not see any problems with sacrificing spatial and temporal scales in order to obtain replication, and those who understand that appropriate scale must always have priority over replication. If an experiment is conducted in a spatial or temporal scale, where the predictions of contesting hypotheses are convergent or ambiguous, no amount of technical impeccability can make the work instructive. Conversely, replication can always be obtained afterwards, by conducting more experiments with basically similar design in different areas and by using meta-analysis. This approach even reduces the sampling bias obtained if resources are allocated to a small number of well-replicated experiments. For a strict advocate of the hypothetico-deductive method, replication is unnecessary even as a matter of principle, unless the predicted response is so weak that random background noise is a plausible excuse for a discrepancy between predictions and results. By definition, a prediction is an 'all- statement', referring to all systems within a well-defined category. What applies to all must apply to any. Hence, choosing two systems and assigning them randomly to a treatment and a control is normally an adequate design for a deductive experiment. The strength of such experiments depends on the firmness of the predictions and their a priori probability of corroboration. Replication is but one of many ways of reducing this probability. Whether the experiment is replicated or not, inferential statistics should always be used, to enable the reader to judge how well the apparent patterns in samples reflect real patterns in statistical populations. The concept 'pseudoreplication' amounts to entirely unwarranted stigmatization of a reasonable way to test predictions referring to large-scale systems.},

Understanding the mechanisms by which bait-resistance can develop is important for the sustainable control of pests worldwide, for both wildlife conservation programs and agricultural production. Bait-resistance is influenced by both behavioural (innate and learned bait-avoidance behaviour) and physiological aspects of the target pest species (its natural diet, its body mass, the mode of action of the toxin, and the animal's ability to biochemically break down the toxin). In this review, we summarise the scientific literature, discuss factors that can lead to innate and learned aversion to baits, as well as physiological tolerance. We address the question of whether bait avoidance or tolerance to 1080 could develop in the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), an introduced predator of significant economic and environmental importance in Australia. Sublethal poisoning has been identified as the primary cause of both bait avoidance and increased toxin-tolerance, and so, finally, we provide examples of how management actions can minimise the risk of sublethal baits in pest species populations.},

Ecological theory predicts that elimination of top-introduced predators from islands can lead to the counterintuitive decline of native prey populations through the ecological release of smaller introduced species in a process termed "mesopredator release." We show, in accordance with mesopredator release theory and counter to conservation goals for a New Zealand island reserve, that initial eradication of cats on Little Barrier Island led to reduced breeding success of Cook's petrels, which also are vulnerable to predation by a mesopredator, the Pacific rat. The rat's impact on prey productivity varied with elevation within the island. Rat eradication was followed by a rise in petrel productivity, in support of both ecological theory and practical conservation management goals. It appears that interactions among introduced predators, native prey, and environmental gradients can drive counterintuitive and spatially heterogeneous responses to predator eradications from islands. Location-specific, ecosystem-level understanding is essential for predicting the outcomes of such restoration management techniques.},

The extent to which structure and function of islands where rats have been eradicated will converge on uninvaded islands remains unclear. We compared three groups of islands in New Zealand: islands never invaded by rats, islands with rats, and islands on which rats have been controlled. Differences between island groups in soil and leaf chemistry and leaf production were largely explained by burrow densities. Community structure of woody seedlings differed by rat history and burrow density. Plots on islands with high seabird densities had themost non-native plant species. Sincemost impacts of rats were mediated through seabird density, the removal of rats without seabird recolonization is unlikely to result in a reversal of these processes. Even if seabirds return, a novel plant community may emerge.},

	abstract = {Alpine zones are threatened globally by invasive species, hunting, and habitat loss caused by fire, anthropogenic development and climate change. These global threats are pertinent in New Zealand, with the least understood pressure being the potential impacts of introduced mammalian predators, the focus of this review. In New Zealand, alpine zones include an extensive suite of cold climate ecosystems covering c. 11\% of the land mass. They support rich communities of indigenous invertebrates, lizards, fish, and birds. Many taxa are obligate alpine dwellers, though there is uncertainty about the extent to which distributions of some species are relicts of wider historical ranges. The impacts of introduced mammalian predators are well described in many New Zealand ecosystems, though little is known about the impacts of these predators on alpine fauna. Here we review the importance of alpine habitats for indigenous fauna and the impacts of introduced mammalian predators; and develop a conceptual model explaining threat interactions. Most evidence for predation is anecdotal or comes from studies of species with wider ranges and at lower altitudes. Nevertheless, at least ten introduced predator species have been confirmed as frequent predators ofnative alpine species, particularly among birds and invertebrates. In the case of the endangered takahe (Porphyrio hochstetteri) and rock wren (Xenicus gilviventris), stoats (Mustela erminea) are primary predators, which are likely to be impacting significantly on population viability. We also document records of mammalian predation on alpine lizards and freshwater fish. While the precise impacts on the long-teen viability of threatened species have not been evaluated, anecdotal evidence suggests that predation by mammals is a serious threat, warranting predator control.

We used seed production data from nine elevations and a site- and species-specific net carbon (C) availability model from two elevations (1050 in and 1340 IT) to examine how three variables (temperature, soil moisture, and net C availability) during three key periods (resource priming, flowering primordia development, and flowering) influence seed production. These three strongly interrelated variables have all been considered determinants of seed production but have not previously been tested together in a single analysis. Seed production increased over the 30-year period, with the greatest increases at high elevations; this increase was driven by a greater frequency of intermediate- sized seeding years. We then determined how temperature, soil moisture, and net C availability determined seeding, and examined whether temporal trends in the seeding data could be linked to similar temporal trends in temperature, soil moisture, or net C availability. High seed production was related to cool summers with high soil moisture during resource priming, warm summers during flower primordia development, and low net C availability during flowering. Positive temporal trends in temperatures during the period of flower primordia development accounted for the increase in seed production, suggesting that increasing temperatures are promoting more frequent seed production at high elevations.},

	abstract = {Population viability analysis was used to assess the survival prospects of mohua (Mohoua ochrocephala) populations of varying sizes, with different breeding strategies and suffering predation episodes at varying frequencies, from the South Island of New Zealand. Mohua populations in which most pairs attempted to raise two broods of chicks each year were more vulnerable to episodic stoat (Mustela erminea) predation than were populations in which pairs attempted to raise only one brood. However, those populations in which most pairs raised two broods had a much better ability to recover following predation. High stoat numbers every year would lead to the extinction of mohua populations regardless of their size and breeding strategy, but one-brood populations would decline more slowly. If stoat populations were high only once every 5 years (the likely natural rate in South Island beech forests), small populations, and populations in which most pairs raised only one brood a year, would have very low survival prospects, but two-brood populations of more than about 40 pairs would have good survival prospects. Reduction in stoat densities, particularly in years when their numbers are high, is likely to have a substantial positive effect on mohua populations.},

	abstract = {The population dynamics of ship rats (Rattus rattus L.) were studied in podocarp/hardwood and hard beech (Nothofagus truncata) forest in the Orongorongo Valley, near Wellington, from 1971 to 1998. Rat density (indexed by captures in 116 snap traps over 3 nights per quarter) varied up to five-fold between consecutive years. Fruiting of hinau (Elaeocarpus dentatus) and hard beech did not drive the fluctuations as had been suggested. Average density increased over the first 15 years of the study (from 2.3 Â± 0.3 to 7.5 Â± 0.8 per 100 trap-nights (mean Â± SE)), and then declined; this mirrored a trend in cat density driven by external factors. Breeding was largely restricted to spring (November) and summer (February). Breeding rate (proportion pregnant or lactating) was density-dependent, particularly in older rats. Litter size (based on live embryos and new uterine scars) increased between spring (4.4 Â± 0.4) and summer (5.5 Â± 0.3) (mean Â± SE), but did not vary with density or age. Winter breeding was rare (2\% pregnant or lactating in August). Hinau fruitfall did not predict the proportion breeding in autumn (May), or survival in winter-spring (i.e., population change between August and November). Varying predation intensity was the most likely explanation for the population trend. We review other New Zealand studies and question the assumption that ship rat populations are "eruptive", except possibly when predation is eliminated. Â© The Royal Society of New Zealand 2006.},

It was thought to pose little risk to seabirds, but video evidence from Gough Island, South Atlantic Ocean shows house mice killing chicks of two IUCN-listed seabird species. Mouse-induced mortality in 2004 was a significant cause of extremely poor breeding success for Tristan albatrosses, Diomedea dabbenena (0.27 fledglings/pair), and Atlantic petrels, Pterodroma incerta (0.33). Population models show that these levels of predation are sufficient to cause population decreases. Unlike many other islands, mice are the only introduced mammals on Gough Island. However, restoration programmes to eradicate rats and other introduced mammals from islands are increasing the number of islands where mice are the sole alien mammals. If these mouse populations are released from the ecological effects of predators and competitors, they too may become predatory on seabird chicks.},

Paired treatment and non-treatment sites in the Rolleston Range (East Coast, South Island) and Alexander Range (West Coast, South Island) were monitored once before 1080 treatment during winter 2012 and for three successive summers afterwards. Mammals (possums Trichosurus vulpecula, rats Rattus spp. and mice Mus musculus) were monitored with chew cards, and forest birds with five-minute counts. Possums decreased to negligible levels in treatment sites, but increased over time in non-treatment sites. Rats were only present at the West Coast sites, where there was a significant, but short-lived, decrease post-1080. Mouse abundance showed almost no effects post-1080, but increased at the East Coast sites after a beech (Nothofagus spp.) mast seeding event. No common native bird species showed short-term negative effects post-1080. Three species – tomtit (Petroica macrocephala), silvereye (Zosterops lateralis), grey warbler (Gerygone igata) – increased significantly. Longer-term effects on birds were nearly all neutral or positive, including bellbirds which increased three-fold in treatment areas. In non-treatment areas, higher possum densities were correlated with subsequent decreases in bird counts (averaged across all species). Overall, the one-off aerial 1080 treatment had conservation benefits.},

	abstract = {Populations of house mice were sampled on nine grids in Fiordland National Park between May and No- vember 1999, using live-capture and footprint-tracking tunnel methods. Trapped mice were removed from three grids (approximately 3.24 ha each), and marked and released on the other six. Density estimates were obtained using recapture data from the grids where mice were released (Mh (jackknife) model from program CAPTURE), and rate- of-capture data from grids where mice were removed (Mbh (removal) CAPTURE model). Density estimates were used to evaluate the performance of 4 indices of mouse abundance by contrasting R2-values of their regression on estimated mouse density. Indices evaluated were: minimum number of individuals known to be alive (MNA) (total number of individual mice caught over the course of a trapping session), one-night trap catch (number of mice caught on first night of each trapping session expressed as captures per 100 trap-nights), three-night trap catch (same index estimated from number of mice caught over the first three nights), and tracking-tunnel index (propor- tion of nine tunnels that had mouse tracks). While MNA, one-night trap catch, and three-night trap catch were all significantly correlated with estimated density, MNA was most strongly correlated, with R2 varying between 0.67 to 0.87 depending on whether 3, 4 or 5 nights’ capture data were used. Variation in tracking-tunnel index was unre- lated to mouse density on our grids.},

	abstract = {Predicting the dynamics and impacts of multiple invasive species can be complex because ecological relationships, which occur among several trophic levels, are often incompletely understood. Further, the complexity of these trophic relationships exacerbates our inability to predict climate change effects on invaded ecosystems. We explore the hypothesis that interactions between two global change drivers, invasive vertebrates and climate change, will potentially make matters worse for native biodiversity. In New Zealand beech (Nothofagus spp.) forests, a highly irruptive invasive mammal community is driven by multi-annual resource pulses of beech seed (masting). Because mast frequency is predicted to increase with climate change, we use this as a model system to explore the extent to which such effects may influence invasive vertebrate communities, and the implications of such interactions for native biodiversity and its management. We build on an established model of trophic interactions in the system, combining it with a logistic probability mast function, the parameters of which were altered to simulate either contemporary conditions or conditions of more or less frequent masting. The model predicts that increased mast frequency will lead to populations of a top predator (the stoat) and a mesopredator (the ship rat) becoming less irruptive and being maintained at appreciably higher average abundances in this forest type. In addition, the ability of both current and in-development management approaches to suppress invasive mammals is predicted to be compromised. Because invasive mammals are key drivers of native fauna extinction in New Zealand, with the additional loss of associated functions such as pollination and seed dispersal, these predictions imply potentially serious adverse impacts of climate change for the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem function. Our study also highlights the importance of long-term monitoring data for assessing and managing future impacts of global change drivers.},

	abstract = {(1) There was a significant relationship between seedfall and populations of mice in all forests studied. Good seedfalls were followed by increases in density of mice and changes in population structure not seen in years when the seedfall failed. Predictability of these changes decreased with increasing diversity of forest composition. (2) Stoats responded both numerically and functionally to increases in mice. There was a significant relationship between the densities of mice and of stoats in summer in two forests. (In a third, this relationship was modified by the presence nearby of many lagomorphs, an important alternative prey for stoats.) The numerical response was due to increased survival, in the uterus or the nest, of young stoats born in spring when mice were abundant, not to increased fecundity of adult female stoats. In all three forests, stoats ate significantly more mice in the summers that mice were abundant. (3) Ship rats (Rattus rattus (L.)) were most abundant in the most diverse of the three forests. The density index for R. rattus increased there after the 1976 seedfall, but not after that of 1979. A few kiore (R. exulans (Peale)) coexisted with R. rattus in this forest. (4) Stoats did not eat significantly fewer birds when there were plenty of mice, either in summer or autumn, but nevertheless there was a significant negative correlation between the proportions of birds and mice in the diet in autumn. In summer this correlation was very weak and probably non-existent. (5) A `bird predation index', which takes into account both the numbers of stoats present and what they ate, suggests that more birds are eaten in summers of peak numbers of mice and stoats, because of the strong numerical response by stoats to mice and lack of `buffering' of birds by mice. In autumn this effect is weakened by a regular seasonal switch by stoats from birds to mice, especially in the autumn of a mouse peak year. (6) The indirect effects of mouse irruptions on populations of forest birds in New Zealand should be further examined. Control of stoats in mouse peak summers could prevent a temporary increase in predation on birds by stoats during the highest risk period, though whether this would benefit the birds is unknown.

	title = {Unexpected consequences of vertebrate pest control: {Predictions} from a four-species community model},
	volume = {16},
	abstract = {Although indirect effects are important structuring forces in ecological communities, they are seldom considered in the design of pest control operations. However, such effects may cause unpredicted and deleterious changes in other populations that could reduce or even negate the benefit to endangered species for which control is undertaken. Furthermore, the complexity and nonlinearities inherent in interacting ecological communities may cause thresholds in the strength of pest control, on either side of which indirect effects could vary greatly in their magnitude and desirability. We constructed a four-species simulation model for a common pest community in New Zealand beech (Nothofagus spp.) forests: house mice, ship rats, stoats, and brushtail possums. When the model was perturbed to simulate common control techniques, marked increases in the abundance of nontarget pest species were observed at the next forest mast. Higher mouse numbers were observed following both toxin (1080) application and rat kill-trapping, and higher rat numbers were observed following stoat kill-trapping, due to a release from predation in all cases. In comparison, a marked decrease in stoat abundance at the next forest mast was observed following simultaneous control of rats and mice, due to the effects of decreased prey abundance on the stoat population. For rat control, the size of the indirect effect on mouse numbers increased monotonically with control strength. Because the curvature of the relationship is slight, the relationship between the direct benefits of control and the indirect costs incurred would remain relatively unchanged regardless of the strength of control employed. For simultaneous mouse and rat control, however, high levels of control (as initially simulated) were predicted to cause decreased peak stoat abundance at the next mast event, whereas intermediate and low levels of control were predicted to cause increased stoat abundance. Hence, this study demonstrates two points of concern for pest managers. First, indirect effects of control operations do have the potential to reduce the planned-for benefit. Second, thresholds in the strength of control employed can potentially occur, across which indirect effects switch from being of conservation benefit to being of conservation concern.},

We examined variation among populations and species in the magnitude of estimates of error components and density dependence using generalized linear models. Process error exceeded observation error in 75\% of all populations, and on average, both components of error were greater in Rangifer than in Cervus populations. Observation error differed significantly across the different observation methods, and predation and time-series length differentially affected the error components. Comparing the Bayesian model results to traditional models that do not separate error components revealed the potential for misleading inferences about sources of variation in population dynamics.},

The specific hypothesis is that climate influences the relationship between lynx and hare abundance. Methods We evaluate 10 linear relationships between predator and prey abundance and effects of climate. We use data on lynx and snowshoe hare abundance over 21 years in the Yukon as the predatorprey system, and three alternative broad-scale climate indices: the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the Pacific North American (PNA) index and the North Pacific index (NPI). Key results There was more support, as assessed by Akaike weights (i=0.600), evidence ratio (=4.73) and R 2 (=0.77) for a model of predator (lynx) and prior prey (hare) abundance with an effect of prior climate (winter NAO) when combined in a multiplicative, rather than in an additive, manner. The results infer that climate changes the amplitude of the lynx cycle with lower predator (lynx) abundance with positive values of winter NAO for a given hare density. Conclusions The study provides evidence that predatorprey dynamics are related to climate in an interactive manner. The ecological mechanism for the interactive effect is not clear, and alternative hypotheses are proposed for future evaluation. Implications The study implies that changes in climate may alter predatorprey relationships. © 2011 CSIRO.},

	abstract = {Repeatability (more precisely the common measure of repeatability, the intra-class correlation coefficient, ICC) is an important index for quantifying the accuracy of measurements and the constancy of phenotypes. It is the proportion of phenotypic variation that can be attributed to between-subject (or between-group) variation. As a consequence, the non-repeatable fraction of phenotypic variation is the sum of measurement error and phenotypic flexibility. There are several ways to estimate repeatability for Gaussian data, but there are no formal agreements on how repeatability should be calculated for non-Gaussian data (e.g. binary, proportion and count data). In addition to point estimates, appropriate uncertainty estimates (standard errors and confidence intervals) and statistical significance for repeatability estimates are required regardless of the types of data. We review the methods for calculating repeatability and the associated statistics for Gaussian and non-Gaussian data. For Gaussian data, we present three common approaches for estimating repeatability: correlation-based, analysis of variance (ANOVA)-based and linear mixed-effects model (LMM)-based methods, while for non-Gaussian data, we focus on generalised linear mixed-effects models (GLMM) that allow the estimation of repeatability on the original and on the underlying latent scale. We also address a number of methods for calculating standard errors, confidence intervals and statistical significance; the most accurate and recommended methods are parametric bootstrapping, randomisation tests and Bayesian approaches. We advocate the use of LMM-and GLMM-based approaches mainly because of the ease with which confounding variables can be controlled for. Furthermore, we compare two types of repeatability (ordinary repeatability and extrapolated repeatability) in relation to narrow-sense heritability. This review serves as a collection of guidelines and recommendations for biologists to calculate repeatability and heritability from both Gaussian and non-Gaussian data.},

Naturally, they reflect the statistical conditions of that era: scarce, e.g. n {\textless} 10, data originating in benchtop or agricultural experiments; algorithms communicated via algebraic formulas. Today, applied statistics relates to a different environment: software is the means of algorithmic communication, observational and "unplanned" data are interpreted for causal relationships, and data are large both in n and the number of variables. This change in situation calls for a thorough rethinking of the topics in and approach to statistics education. This paper presents a set of ten organizing blocks for intro stats that are better suited to today's environment.},

We present a new phylogenetic analysis of morphological characters and map these characters onto a recently published phylogenetic tree obtained from DNA sequence data. Results of these and previous analyses strongly support the monophyly of four clades of Nothofagaceae that are currently treated as subgenera of Nothofagus. The four clades of Nothofagaceae are robust and well-supported, with deep stem divergences, have evolutionary equivalence with other genera of Fagales, and can be circumscribed with morphological characters. We argue that these morphological and molecular differences are sufficient for the four clades of Nothofagaceae to be recognised at the primary rank of genus, and that this classification will be more informative and efficient than the currently circumscribed Nothofagus with four subgenera. Nothofagus is recircumscribed to include five species from southern South America, Lophozonia and Trisyngyne are reinstated, and the new genus Fuscospora is described. Fuscospora and Lophozonia, with six and seven species respectively, occur in New Zealand, southern South America and Australia. Trisyngyne comprises 25 species from New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Indonesia. New combinations are provided where necessary in each of these genera.},

	abstract = {In 2016, the New Zealand Government announced a policy to rid the country of key introduced predators (possums (Trichosurus vulpecula), ship rats (Rattus rattus), Norway rats (R. norvegicus) and mustelids (Mustela spp.)) by 2050. An interim goal under this policy is to remove all mammalian predators (the key species as well as mice (Mus musculus), kiore (R. exulans), cats (Felis catus), pigs (Sus scrofa) and hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus)) from island nature reserves by 2025. We identify the New Zealand islands over one hectare managed as reserves by the Department of Conservation (DOC) that have mammalian predators that can be eradicated. There are over 850 islands, islets, stacks and vegetated rocks in the New Zealand archipelago. We exclude islands in lakes and rivers and those smaller than one hectare, which leaves 616 islands, less than half of which are under some form of reserve status (286 islands entirely managed by DOC and 13 under mixed tenures but with some reserve land). One or more mammalian predators are known to occur on 48 of these islands, with the Government's 2050 target species on 42 islands and other predators (in the absence of the target species) on six islands. The Government's 2025 goal nominates one class of reserve, nature reserves. Of the 48 islands, just four islands are classed as nature reserves – two (Mauitaha and Araara Islands) with protected kiore in the Hen and Chickens group and two in the Auckland Islands group (Auckland with mice, cats and pigs; and Masked with mice and cats) – i.e. none with the key species of the wider 2050 goal. Therefore, we consider other reserve classes but place more or less strict risks of reinvasion, as indexed by known swimming ranges of the predators, to judge the feasibility of eradication. Relaxing the reserve class of the island, but not our selection of swimming ranges, results in 15 candidate islands where all mammalian predators present could be eradicated for the 2025 interim goal. Decisions on which islands to select for the programme need to consider costs and other constraints to eradicate different combinations of predators, and whether the island and its predators provide templates for the wider vision of a predator-free New Zealand, i.e. whether any of the key 2050 predators are present, the size of the island, and/or the presence of human inhabitants that complicate the predators to be targeted or constrain the use of some control methods.},

The best way of converting population estimates of livetrapped small mammals to population density is not clear. We estimated population density on livetrapping grids with 4 estimators applied to 3 species of boreal forest and 3 species of tundra rodents to test for relative differences in density estimators. We used 2 spatial estimators proposed by Efford (2009) and 2 traditional boundary-strip estimators designed for grid livetrapping. We analyzed mark–recapture data from 104 trapping sessions from the boreal forest at Kluane, Yukon (n = 4,818 individuals), and 56 trapping sessions from tundra areas of Herschel Island and Komakuk Beach in northern Yukon (n = 1,327 individuals). For boreal forest rodents on average both boundary-strip methods produced density estimates larger than Efford's maximum-likelihood (ML) estimator by as much as 50\% at all population densities up to 25 animals/ha. For tundra rodents both boundary-strip methods produced density estimates smaller than Efford's ML at low density ({\textless}1.5/ha) and larger than Efford's ML density by 36–63\% at high density (25/ha). Efford's inverse prediction estimator produced larger density estimates than the ML estimator by 4\% for the boreal forest and 32\% for the tundra rodents. Relationships were high between all the estimators, such that trends in density could be inferred from all methods. Determining the bias in population density estimators in small mammals will require data from populations spatially closed and completely enumerated. For our small mammals Efford's ML estimator typically provided density estimates smaller than those produced by conventional boundary-strip estimators.},

	abstract = {The genus Nothofagus in New Zealand and Australia exhibits strong mast seeding (i.e. highly variable seed crops between years). Seed crop variation is synchronized within and between species over large spatial scales, and results in greatly increased wind pollination efficiency which could provide a selective benefit favouring the maintenance of mast seeding. However, the null hypothesis (that plants simply match their reproductive effort to the variable resources available each year) has not been tested in Nothofagus. Here we use a 33-year dataset on seedfall and wood ring increments for 19 individual Nothofagus truncata trees at Orongorongo, New Zealand, to test for the presence of switching (exaggeration of seedfall variability by diverting resources into, then out of, reproduction). A generalized least squares model explained 40.7\% of the variance in standardized ring widths, using six weather variables (absolute minimum temperatures in March (lag 0) April (lag 0 and lag 1), May (lag 0) and rainfall in November and February (lag 0) ) and seedfall. Seedfall had a negative relationship with the current year's ring widths even after controlling for all significant weather variables. This shows that switching is occurring in N. truncata within individuals among years, and therefore that masting in this species is the result of selective forces such as increased wind pollination efficiency. As this result has been demonstrated for very few masting species, we call for this test to be applied more widely.},

	abstract = {Control operations for invasive ship rats, Rattus rattus, in New Zealand forests are often followed by increased house mouse, Mus musculus, detections suggesting rats suppress mice. A potential mechanism is intraguild predation, either by interference competition or as simple predatory behaviour. If aggression by rats towards mice is mainly competitive, it should include threat and display features associated with, for example, intraspecific fighting. If predatory, it should lack these features and be associated with feeding. In the first of two captive experiments we observed interactions between paired, live rodents, either side of a wire-mesh screen, and found that most rats were aggressive to mice. This aggression lacked threat and display characteristics typical of encounters with conspecifics and was rarely reciprocated by mice. In a second experiment, euthanized mice were drawn by a line through cages occupied by rats fed either a restricted or unrestricted diet. Rats of both groups attacked and restrained the euthanized mice, and all rats that interacted with the mice ate at least part of them, although food-restricted rats tended to eat more. As the aggressive response of ship rats towards mice lacked threat and display features and was related to feeding, we conclude that it resembles predatory behaviour. Our findings provide a better understanding of the interactions between ship rats and house mice, which hinder their management where they coexist as damaging invaders. However, further research is required to determine whether the results of our captive experiments are consistent with wild rat behaviour. © 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

	abstract = {Invasive species are the greatest threat to island ecosystems, which harbour nearly half the world’s endangered biodiversity. However, eradication is more feasible on islands than on continents. We present a global analysis of 1,224 successful eradications of invasive plants and animals on 808 islands. Most involve single vertebrate species on uninhabited islands, but plant and invertebrate eradications occur more often on inhabited islands. Inhabited islands are often highly modified and support numerous introduced species. Consequently, targeting a single invasive species can be ineffective or counterproductive. The impacts of other pests will continue and, in some cases, be exacerbated. The presence of people also creates regulatory, logistical and socio-political constraints. Real or perceived health risks to inhabitants, pets and livestock may restrict the use of some eradication tools, and communities or individuals sometimes oppose eradication. Despite such challenges, managing invasive species is vital to conserve and restore the unique biodiversity of many inhabited islands, and to maintain or improve the welfare and livelihoods of island residents. We present a brief case study of the Juan Ferna´ndez Archipelago, Chile, and discuss the feasibility of eradicating large suites of invasive plants and animals from inhabited islands while managing other invaders for which eradication is not feasible or desirable. Eradications must be planned to account for species interactions. Monitoring and contingency plans must detect and address any ‘surprise effects’. Above all, it is important that the local community derives social, cultural and/or economic benefits, and that people support and are engaged in the restoration effort.},

	abstract = {A computer model of the population dynamics of introduced house mice (Mus musculus L.), ship rats (Rattus rattus L.) and stoats (Mustela erminea L.) in New Zealand forest was constructed, to test the relative importance of food availability and predation in shaping observed small-mammal population dynamics. Ship rats and mice are the two common rodent species present in most New Zealand forests, and exhibit eruptive population dynamics. Stoats are the only common mammalian predator, and undergo large density fluctuations following periodic rodent eruptions. A number of outputs and predictions from the model were developed. The model highlights the overall importance of variation in food availability in determining the timing and amplitude of rodent population eruptions. It indicates that predators can not prevent a prey-species eruption, primarily due to differences in reproductive biology. Predation however, can delay the start of the prey-population increase during the eruption. The role of predators in limiting the peak prey-population size will depend on the size of the energy input. In a full-scale eruption following maximal tree seeding, predators cannot significantly truncate peak prey-population size. Predators should be able to significantly hasten the rate of decline in the prey populations, although the strength of predator limitation will depend on the severity of food limitation and cold-induced mortality over the same period. Predators can limit prey populations during the post-crash low phase. As with the crash phase, the strength of predator limitation in the low phase will depend on the severity of food limitation and natural mortality. The model highlights gaps in current knowledge of predator and prey species biology and ecology. The model highlights key areas where further field study should provide a better understanding of the factors driving small-mammal communities in New Zealand. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

	abstract = {In many forested ecosystems, the architecture and functional ecology of certain tree species define forest structure and their species-specific traits control ecosystem dynamics. Such foundation tree species are declining throughout the world due to introductions and outbreaks of pests and pathogens, selective removal of individual taxa, and over-harvesting. Through a series of case studies, we show that the loss of foundation tree species changes the local environment on which a variety of other species depend; how this disrupts fundamental ecosystem processes, including rates of decomposition, nutrient fluxes, carbon sequestration, and energy flow; and dramatically alters the dynamics of associated aquatic ecosystems. Forests in which dynamics are controlled by one or a few foundation species appear to be dominated by a small number of strong interactions and may be highly susceptible to alternating between stable states following even small perturbations. The ongoing decline of many foundation species provides a set of important, albeit unfortunate, opportunities to develop the research tools, models, and metrics needed to identify foundation species, anticipate the cascade of immediate, short- and long-term changes in ecosystem structure and function that will follow from their loss, and provide options for remedial conservation and management.},

A surge of interest in this area was catalyzed by the observation that evolution by natural selection can operate at the same contemporary timescales as ecological dynamics. Specifically, recent eco-evolutionary research focuses on how rapid adaptation influences ecology, and vice versa. Evolution by non-adaptive forces also occurs quickly, with ecological consequences, but understanding the full scope of ecology–evolution (eco–evo) interactions requires explicitly addressing population-level processes – genetic and demographic. We show the strong ecological effects of non-adaptive evolutionary forces and, more broadly, the value of population-level research for gaining a mechanistic understanding of eco–evo interactions. The breadth of eco-evolutionary research should expand to incorporate the breadth of evolution itself.},

The survey used a standardised arrangement of trap type, trap spacing and two types of bait, roasted coconut and dried fish. Forty locations were surveyed, using 200 traps at each location for a total of four nights (800 trap-nights/survey site). In all, 309 individuals of 22 species of rodents were trapped using snap-traps and cage-traps. Seven species constituted 75\% of captures as follows: Rattus hoffmani (17.1\%), R. marmosurus (15.2\%), Bunomys chrysocomus (12.3\%), B. prolatus (11.6\%), B. penitus (9.7\%), Paruromys dominator (9.7\%) and Taeromys celebensis (8.1\%). Significantly more rats were captured in cage-traps (171 individuals) than snap-traps (138 individuals) and dried coconut was preferred (196 individuals) to fish as bait (113 individuals). Rodent diversity as measured by Fisher’s α peaked in the altitude range 1200–1500 m asl and generally declined at higher elevations. However, a secondary peak above 2100 m in diversity reflected the very low and even abundance of upper montane species. Simpson’s and Shannon–Weiner indices were relatively constant across all altitude categories. Among the surveyed vegetation types, rodent diversity was highest in cloud forest, upper montane forest, montane forest, lower montane moist forest, swamp forest and marsh habitats, and lowest diversity in lower montane forest, lowland forest and monsoon forest. Fisher’s α and Simpson’s diversity indices attained highest values in the Kototinggi land system and for Shannon–Weiner index in the Telawi land system.},

Increasingly, these eradications are contested by activists claiming moral, legal, cultural, historic or scientific reasons and poorly documented evidence of effects. We reviewed the global literature on the effects of rats on island flora and fauna. We then used New Zealand as a case study because of its four-decade history of rat eradications and many detailed and innovative studies of how rats affect native species. These include use of exclosures, local manipulations of rat populations, video surveillance, and measurements of responses following eradications. The most intensive studies have been on the Pacific rat (Rattus exulans), a small South-East Asian species spread by Polynesians throughout the Pacific. These and the more recently introduced Norway rat (R. norvegicus) and ship (roof) rat (R. rattus) suppress some forest plants, and are associated with extinctions or declines of flightless invertebrates, ground-dwelling reptiles, land birds, and burrowing seabirds. On islands off France, Norway rats are also implicated in declines of shrews. Globally, ship rats were associated with declines or extinctions of the largest number of indigenous vertebrate species (60), including small mammals such as deer mice and bats. Effects of rats on forest trees and seabird populations are sufficiently pervasive to affect ecosystem structure and function. However, the data are patchy. Deficiencies in our knowledge would be reduced by documenting distribution and abundance of indigenous species before and after eradications. Comprehensive measurements of the responses of indigenous species to rat eradications would enable the development of testable models of rat invasion effect},

	abstract = {Hierarchical modeling of abundance in space or time using closed-population mark-recapture under heterogeneity (model {\textbackslash}({\textbackslash}hbox \{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}text \{h\}\}{\textbackslash})) presents two challenges: (i) finding a flexible likelihood in which abundance appears as an explicit parameter and (ii) fitting the hierarchical model for abundance. The first challenge arises because abundance not only indexes the population size, it also determines the dimension of the capture probabilities in heterogeneity models. A common approach is to use data augmentation to include these capture probabilities directly into the likelihood and fit the model using Bayesian inference via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Two such examples of this approach are (i) explicit trans-dimensional MCMC, and (ii) superpopulation data augmentation. The superpopulation approach has the advantage of simple specification that is easily implemented in BUGS and related software. However, it reparameterizes the model so that abundance is no longer included, except as a derived quantity. This is a drawback when hierarchical models for abundance, or related parameters, are desired. Here, we analytically compare the two approaches and show that they are more closely related than might appear superficially. We exploit this relationship to specify the model in a way that allows us to include abundance as a parameter and that facilitates hierarchical modeling using readily available software such as BUGS. We use this approach to model trends in grizzly bear abundance in Yellowstone National Park from 1986 to 1998.},

	abstract = {Islands are important for the conservation of biodiversity because they house 20\% of terrestrial plant and vertebrate species, have suffered 64\% of IUCN-listed extinctions and have 45\% of IUCN-listed critically endangered species. Yet islands make up only about five percent of the earths surface. The main cause of extinction and endangerment to biodiversity on islands is the presence of invasive vertebrates. Fortunately, many future extinctions can be prevented by eradicating invasive vertebrates from islands. To assess the current state of this conservation tool, we are compiling a global database of terrestrial vertebrate eradications from islands, including successes and failures. To date, in the Global Islands Invasives Vertebrate Eradication Database we have documented approximately 950 island eradication attempts involving 28 species of invasive vertebrates in 12 families. These are preliminary data and will be updated and checked for accuracy as part of the Island Invasives: Eradication and Management conference, Auckland 2010. Most eradication attempts have been of rodents ({\textgreater}350) and bovid ungulates ({\textgreater}160). Moderate numbers of eradication attempts have been of cats ({\textgreater}90), suid ungulates ({\textgreater}55), and rabbits ({\textgreater}45). Most projects have been on islands smaller than 500 ha (68\%) and in temperate climates (72\%). Targeting eradications on larger and more tropical islands would lead to the protection of more biodiversity. To this end, our vision is to maintain an accurate, web-accessible, regularly updated database that can be used to promote and improve the protection of island ecosystems by eradicating invasive vertebrates.},

	abstract = {The stoat (Mustela erminea) is a specialist predator that evolved to exploit the unstable populations of northern voles and lemmings. It was introduced to New Zealand, where it is pre-adapted to respond with a population irruption to the resource pulses that follow a heavy seedfall of southern beech (Nothofagus spp.). Culling stoats during an irruption is necessary to reduce damaging predation on nesting endemic birds. Culling might not reduce the stoat population long term, however, if high natural mortality exceeds culling mortality in peak years. During other phases of the beech-mast cycle, culling might have a greater effect on a smaller stoat population, whether or not damage prevention is critical. We developed a 4-matrix model to predict the effects of culling on lambda, the annual rate of change in the size of the stoat population, through the four annual phases of an average masting cycle, explicitly distinguishing between apparent and real culling. In the Post-seedfall phase of the cycle, large numbers of stoats are killed, but little of this extra mortality is additive; in other phases, culling removes larger proportions of smaller total numbers of stoats that would otherwise have lived. Culling throughout all phases is most effective at reducing stoat populations, but is also the most expensive option. Culling in Post-seedfall plus Seed or Crash years is somewhat less effective but better than culling in one phase only. Culling has different short-term effects on stoat age distribution depending on the phase of the cycle when culling begins.},

I radio-tracked rats of both species from June 1996 to September 1996, when the first of two aerial poison drops occurred. The aim of the study was to describe the home-range parameters of both species of rat in an area of grassland where they coexisted. Radio-tagged kiore occupied overlapping home ranges that varied from 26 to 89 m in diameter. Norway rats occupied larger home ranges (218–916 m in diameter), which overlapped the home ranges of both other Norway rats and kiore. Jacobs’ indices of cohesiveness indicated that kiore and Norway rats might avoid each other, despite the fact that their home ranges overlapped. Patterns of habitat use suggest that kiore prefer denser habitats than Norway rats. Differing habitat preferences, possibly driven by higher predation risk for kiore in open habitats, might be sufficient to explain coexistence of rodents on Kapiti Island. Further research is needed to elucidate the relative importance of diet, home range use, and predation risk in permitting multi- species assemblages in New Zealand. Keywords:},

	abstract = {Data augmentation (DA) is a flexible tool for analyzing closed and open population models of capture-recapture data, especially models which include sources of hetereogeneity among individuals. The essential concept underlying DA, as we use the term, is based on adding "observations'' to create a dataset composed of a known number of individuals. This new (augmented) dataset, which includes the unknown number of individuals N in the population, is then analyzed using a new model that includes a reformulation of the parameter N in the conventional model of the observed (unaugmented) data. In the context of capture-recapture models, we add a set of "all zero'' encounter histories which are not, in practice, observable. The model of the augmented dataset is a zero-inflated version of either a binomial or a multinomial base model. Thus, our use of DA provides a general approach for analyzing both closed and open population models of all types. In doing so, this approach provides a unified framework for the analysis of a huge range of models that are treated as unrelated "black boxes'' and named procedures in the classical literature. As a practical matter, analysis of the augmented dataset by MCMC is greatly simplified compared to other methods that require specialized algorithms. For example, complex capture-recapture models of an augmented dataset can be fitted with popular MCMC software packages (WinBUGS or JAGS) by providing a concise statement of the model's assumptions that usually involves only a few lines of pseudocode. In this paper, we review the basic technical concepts of data augmentation, and we provide examples of analyses of closed-population models (M-0, M-h, distance sampling, and spatial capture-recapture models) and open-population models (Jolly-Seber) with individual effects.},

	abstract = {Sugar-rich honeydew production by phloem-feeding sooty beech scale insects (Ultracoelostoma spp.) is a keystone ecological process in New Zealand beech (Nothofagus) forest. A dynamical model to describe the formation of individual honeydew droplets is derived using simple fluid dynamics. The model assumes that the insects play little part in regulating flow, and that flow is driven by phloem hydrostatic pressure and regulated by environmental conditions affecting water evaporation from droplets. The model predicts different types of behaviour depending on local environmental conditions. In dry conditions, evaporation rates are high and honeydew droplets can become so concentrated that further excretion is prevented and droplet formation ceases. In humid conditions, the high concentrations required to prevent droplet formation do not occur and droplets continue to grow indefinitely. The model is fitted to new data and the data are used to estimate values for the rate of flow of phloem sap through the insect and for the concentration required to prevent further excretion. Model predictions provide a close qualitative match to field data. However, rates of fluid flow from the trees through the insects would need to be much greater than the model assumes to produce values for droplet production that match field data. This suggests that the insects are playing an active role in regulating the flow rate. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Holdaway (1989) described three phases of historical extinctions and declines in New Zealand avifauna, the last of which (Group III, declining 1780–1986) was associated with European hunting, habitat clearance, and predation and competition from introduced European mammals. Some forest bird species have continued to decline since 1986, while others have increased, usually after intensive species-specific research and management programmes. In this paper, we review what is known about major causes of current declines or population limitation, including predation, competition for food or another resource, disease, forest loss, and genetic problems such as inbreeding depression and reduced genetic variation. Much experimental and circumstantial evidence suggests or demonstrates that predation by introduced mammals remains the primary cause of declines and limitation in remaining large native forest tracts. Predation alone is generally sufficient to explain the observed declines, but complex interactions between factors that vary between species and sites are likely to be the norm and are difficult to study. Currently, the rather limited evidence for food shortage is mostly circumstantial and may be obscured by interactions with predation. Climate and food supply determine the number of breeding attempts made by herbivorous species, but predation by introduced mammals ultimately determines the outcome of those attempts. After removal of pest mammals, populations are apparently limited by other factors, including habitat area, food supply, disease or avian predators. Management of these, and of inbreeding depression in bottlenecked populations, is likely to assist the effectiveness and resilience of management programmes. At the local or regional scale, however, forest area itself may be limiting in deforested parts of New Zealand. Without predator management, the number of native forest birds on the New Zealand mainland is predicted to continue to decline.},

The purpose of this documentation is to present a practical understanding and implimentation of a Bayesian Hierarchical model. Bayesian Hierarchical models allow analysts to account for endogeneity. A Bayesian Hierarchical model is a Bayesian network, a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional dependencies via a directed acyclic graph . Bayesian Hierarchical models subset themselves by containing three or more levels of random variables or use latent variables. One level uses within-unit analysis and another level for across-unit analysis. Within-unit model de-scribes individual respondents over time. Across-unit analysis is used to describe the diversity, or heterogeneity, of the units.},

	abstract = {Free-roaming cats are at increased risk of injuring themselves as well as other domestic and fauna species, yet relatively little is known about the frequency at which risk and predation behaviors occur in a typical day. In this study, cat risk, and predation behavioral information was collected using animal-borne video cameras and global positioning system (GPS) units that were attached to break-free cat collars. The observation period was one to three consecutive days for 37 convenience sampled free-roaming owned cats in Auckland, New Zealand. Video footage was manually reviewed and all predation and risk behavior events were recorded. These included stalking, pursuing, and seizing prey as well as altercations with other cats, ingesting harmful substances, and venturing into hazardous locations such as roads and storm drains. During the observation period, 23 of the 37 cats (62.2\%) engaged in a total of 121 predation events. Of these, 40 resulted in successful prey capture with 18 of the 40 captures involving New Zealand native fauna species. Invertebrates were the most common taxa preyed upon (n = 55; 46\%), followed by skinks (n = 8; 7\%). No mammalian, avian or amphibian prey were captured and no cat took prey back to their residence. A total of 326 risk behaviors were observed for 32 out of the 37 cats (86.5\%) with the most common being cats venturing onto the road (n = 132; 41\%). Younger cats (aged 1–6 six years) engaged in significantly more predation and risk behaviors than older cats (aged 7 years and above). Sex, breed, number of cats in a household, and geographic location were not found to be predictors of cats’ participation in predation or risk behaviors. Given the high frequency of predation and risk behaviors in free-roaming owned cats, it may be beneficial to educate owners about strategies to minimize risk such as housing them indoors, containing them to their properties or monitoring their time spent outdoors.},

	abstract = {In this review we summarised published knowledge about small mammal population recovery in re-gard to sudden population collapse of small mammal species regardless if it is caused by natural or man-made events. We determined recovery mechanisms, recovery time and recovery rate to make suggestions how to adapt and optimise current Â¬methods for the regulation of small mammal population size for pest management and for conservation. It is vital to know the principles of recovery mechanisms for pest control and conservation to align management methods either to sustainably keep animal abundance at a permanent minimum level or to increase population size. Collapses can be caused naturally as in the decline phase of multi-annual fluctuations and after natu-ral disasters or by man-made events such as pesticide applications. In general, there are two ways for recovery to take place: in situ survival and multiplication of a small remaining fraction of the population, immigration, or a combination thereof. The recovery mechanism strongly depends on life-history strategy, social behaviour and density-dependent processes in population dynamics of the species in question. Also, the kind of disturbance, its intensity and spatial scale as well as environmental circumstances such as the presence and distance of refuge areas have to be taken into account. Recovery time can vary from a couple of days to several years, depending on the speciesâ reproductive potential, and the kind of disturbances no matter whether collapse is man-made or naturally. Ultimately, most populations rebound to levels equal to pre-collapse numbers. Based on present knowledge, case-by-case decisions seem appropriate for small scale conservation action. For pest control operation a large scale approach seems necessary. Further research activities are required to make sound species specific recommendations.},

	abstract = {A paradigm is a set of mutually supportive hypotheses that provides a frame of reference within a field. In 1962, Kuhn proposed that paradigms form within the dual contexts of empirical evidence and intellectual history. Facts potentially contradictory to a paradigm may not be recognized until they are observed repeatedly and incorporated as supportive evidence into a new theory. Support for this interpretation can be found in the history of a paradigm of predation in rocky intertidal communities. Hypotheses were developed in the contexts of innovative field experiments and historical arguments of competition theory. The resulting paradigm proposed that predators restrict populations of competitively dominant prey to refuges. Different types of refuge, or no refuge, prevail in different areas of the intertidal zone, accounting for patterns of prey distribution, the coexistence of natural enemies, and the local maintenance of diversity. An ensuing period of criticism made reference to potential contradictions. Rather than by predation alone, prey abundances are determined largely by an interplay of varying rates of predation and prey production. Furthermore, prey refuges are neither necessary nor sufficient to explain all observed instances of local coexistence of predators and prey. We present a model in which intertidal boundaries of prey are set by equilibria between predation and prey production. Predation and prey productivity vary with environmental gradients and with explicit spatial configurations of the prey. This synthesis relies on insights of the original paradigm, incorporates the contradictory observations, and depends on novel capabilities afforded by spatially explicit computer simulations. The resulting synthesis provides explanations for distinctive aspects of zonation, including abrupt prey boundaries in continuous gradients of predation, and converging upper and lower prey boundaries in gradients of decreasing wave exposure.},

The mean home range of females during the breeding season was not significantly different from that in the non-breeding seasons when estimated by either method. Overlap of home ranges was observed within and between sexes in all seasons, with the greatest proportion of home range overlap being male-female.

Here I present the first global review of the subject, which confirms that large-bodied invertebrates are most at risk from these rodents, and that although a disproportionate number of studies (69\%) are from New Zealand, rodent-invertebrate impacts are geographically widespread. Mechanisms of impact are both direct (mediated by predation) and indirect (involving intermediary species). Some studies also suggest knock-on effects on ecosystem properties, and given the diverse ecological functions of invertebrates (as detritivores, primary consumers, predators, prey and pollinators), I suggest that an understanding of the interactions between invasive rodents and invertebrates in island ecosystems is essential for effective conservation management. Currently many reported impacts are unquantified, come from uncontrolled and unreplicated designs, or rely on time-series with inadequate baseline data. In addition to basic improvements in study design, this review highlights a need for studies which investigate mechanisms of impact, or impacts across trophic levels. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

A common design is that in which multiple distinct populations are sampled, and the research objective is modeling variation in population size \$N\_\{s\}; s=1,2,...,S\$ among the populations such as estimating a treatment effect or some other source of variation related to landscape structure. The problem is naturally resolved using hierarchical models. We provide a Bayesian formulation of such models using data augmentation which preserves the individual encounter histories in the model and, as such, is amenable to modeling individual effects. We formulate the model by conditioning on the total population size among all populations. In this case, the abundance model can be formulated as a multinomial model that allocates individuals among sites. MCMC is easily carried out by the introduction of a categorical individual effect, \$g\_\{i\}\$, which partitions the total population size. The prior distribution for the latent variable \$g\$ is derived from the model assumed for the population sizes \$N\_\{s\}\$.},

Hole-nesting forest birds are particularly vulnerable to predation because they display few predator-avoidance behaviours. Mohua (Molnia ochrocephala) and parakeets are especially at risk because they nest when stoat (Mustela erminea) numbers in the forest are highest, and, because only females incubate, nest predation causes a biassed sex ratio. The Department of Conservation's hole-nesting birds and predator research programme aims to investigate three questions: (1) Are contemporary predators still having a significant impact on the long-term viability of forest bird populations? (2) Can we predict when predators will affect forest bird populations? (3) Can we increase the productivity and viability of forest bird populations by controlling predators? Mohua and yellow-crowned parakeets were used as indicator species to answer these questions, and the resulting eight studies are briefly outlined.},

	abstract = {Although the co-occurrence of nonnative vertebrates is a ubiquitous global phenomenon, the study of interactions between invaders is poorly represented in the literature. Limited understanding of the interactions between co-occurring vertebrates can be problematic for predicting how the removal of only one invasive—a common management scenario—will affect native communities. We suggest a trophic food web framework for predicting the effects of single-species management on native biodi-versity. We used a literature search and meta-analysis to assess current understanding of how the removal of one invasive vertebrate affects native biodiversity relative to when two invasives are present. The majority of studies focused on the removal of carnivores, mainly within aquatic systems, which highlights a critical knowledge gap in our understanding of co-occurring invasive vertebrates. We found that removal of one invasive vertebrate caused a significant negative effect on native species compared to when two invasive vertebrates were present. These unexpected results could arise because of the positioning and hierarchy of the co-occurring invasives in the food web (e.g., carnivore–carnivore or carnivore–herbivore). We consider that there are important knowledge gaps to determinate the effects of multiple co-existing invaders on native ecosystems, and this information could be precious for management.},

	abstract = {Trade-offs among life-history traits are central to evolutionary theory. In quantitative genetic terms, trade-offs may be manifested as negative genetic covariances relative to the direction of selection on phenotypic traits. Although the expression and selection of ecologically important phenotypic variation are fundamentally multivariate phenomena, the in situ quantification of genetic covariances is challenging. Even for life-history traits, where well-developed theory exists with which to relate phenotypic variation to fitness variation, little evidence exists from in situ studies that negative genetic covariances are an important aspect of the genetic architecture of life-history traits. In fact, the majority of reported estimates of genetic covariances among life-history traits are positive. Here we apply theory of the genetics and selection of life histories in organisms with complex life cycles to provide a framework for quantifying the contribution of multivariate genetically based relationships among traits to evolutionary constraint. We use a Bayesian framework to link pedigree-based inference of the genetic basis of variation in life-history traits to evolutionary demography theory regarding how life histories are selected. Our results suggest that genetic covariances may be acting to constrain the evolution of female life-history traits in a wild population of red deer Cervus elaphus: genetic covariances are estimated to reduce the rate of adaptation by about 40\%, relative to predicted evolutionary change in the absence of genetic covariances. Furthermore, multivariate phenotypic (rather than genetic) relationships among female life-history traits do not reveal this constraint.},

Three approaches (demographic, mechanistic and density-dependent) used historically to describe the determinants of population growth rate are here compared and combined for an avian predator, the barn owl (Tyto alba). The owl population remained approximately stable (r ≈ 0) throughout the period from 1979 to 1991. There was no evidence of density dependence as assessed by goodness of fit to logistic population growth. The finite (λ) and instantaneous (r) population growth rates were significantly positively related to food (field vole) availability. The demographic rates, annual adult mortality, juvenile mortality and annual fecundity were reported to be correlated with vole abundance. The best fit (R2 = 0.82) numerical response of the owl population described a positive effect of food (field voles) and a negative additive effect of owl abundance on r. The numerical response of the barn owl population to food availability was estimated from both census and demographic data, with very similar results. Our analysis shows how the demographic and mechanistic determinants of population growth rate are linked; food availability determines demographic rates, and demographic rates determine population growth rate. The effects of food availability on population growth rate are modified by predator abundance.},

	abstract = {In conservation biology it is necessary to make management decisions for endangered and threatened species under severe uncertainty. Failure to acknowledge and treat uncertainty can lead to poor decisions. To illustrate the importance of considering uncertainty, we reanalyze a decision problem for the Sumatran rhino, Dicerorhinus sumatrensis, using information-gap theory to propagate uncertainties and to rank management options. Rather than requiring information about the extent of parameter uncertainty at the outset, information-gap theory addresses the question of how much uncertainty can be tolerated before our decision would change. It assesses the robustness of decisions in the face of severe uncertainty. We show that different management decisions may result when uncertainty in utilities and probabilities are considered in decision-making problems. We highlight the importance of a full assessment of uncertainty in conservation management decisions to avoid, as much as possible, undesirable outcomes. Read More:},

In this paper, we improve the method in four major ways. We use a Markov chain formulation of the life cycle to express the likelihood functions in matrix form, which makes numerical calculations simpler. We introduce a method to in- corporate capture histories with uncertain stage and sex identifications, which allows the use of capture history data with incomplete information. We introduce a simple function that allows multinomial transition probabilities to be written as functions of covariates (time or environmental factors). Finally, we show how to convert transition probabilities estimated by the MSMR method into a matrix population model.

Annual lynx growth rate (r) estimated from lynx tracks was positively related to the ratio of hares per lynx in the best-fitting model (R-2 = 0.55).

@techreport{ricklefs_physiologylife-history_2002,
	title = {The physiology/life-history nexus},
	abstract = {Biodiversity reflects in part the diversification of life histories. However, many potential combinations of life-history traits do not actually occur in nature [1,2]. Indeed, the few major axes of life-history variation stand in stark contrast to the variety of selective pressures on life histories: physical conditions, seasonality and unpredictability of the environment, food availability, predators and disease organisms, and relationships within social and family groups. Most life-history thinking has been concerned with constrained evolutionary responses to the environment. Differences among the life histories of species are viewed commonly as having a genetic basis and reflecting the optimization of phenotypes with respect to their environments. The optimal balance between parental investment and adult self-maintenance is also influenced by the life table of the population, particularly the relative value of present and future reproduction [1,3-5]. Constraints on adaptive responses are established by the allocation of limited time, energy and nutrients among competing functions [6,7]. Relatively less attention has been paid to nongenetic responses to the environment, such as adjustment of parental investment in response to perceived risk, except for the study of phenotypic flexibility (the reaction norm) as a life-history character itself [4,8,9]. Here we argue that physiological function, including endocrine control mechanisms, mediates the relationship of the organism to its environment and therefore is essential to our understanding of the diversification of life histories. Much of the variation in life histories, particularly variation in parental investment and self-maintenance, reflects phenotypic responses of individuals to environmental stresses and perceived risks. As a result, the organization of behavioral and physiological control mechanisms might constrain individual (and evolutionary) responses and limit life-history variation among species. What do we mean by physiology? When referring to physiology, we include aspects of organism function, such as metabolism, nutrition and thermal relationships. These have been considered traditionally in the context of the physiological ecology paradigm, which focuses on particular systems (e.g. the lungs, blood and muscle with regard to the respiratory metabolism of activity) or the integration of systems within the organism (symmorphosis) [10]. With the development of population biology, evolutionary ecology and phylogenetically-based comparative approaches, this paradigm has been transformed gradually into evolutionary physiology, which examines primarily microevolutionary responses of physiological traits [11]. More recently, other aspects of physiology have been deemed essential to understanding organism function. These include phenotypic plasticity, immune responses, endocrine control mechanisms, and behavior and cognition. Studies of the immune system lack a strong comparative empirical foundation currently [12,13], but important relationships between immune responses and other life-history traits have been identified within species [14]. Behavior and, in particular, cognition seem to be fundamental to the organism-environment relationship in ways that we are just beginning to understand [15,16]. However, the links between cognition and life history are tenuous at present. Here, we focus on endocrine control mechanisms because these are reasonably well understood, and a broad comparative approach to endocrine function in natural populations has arisen [17,18]. The endocrine system influences behavior strongly, controls the annual cycle, marks milestones in development, modulates behavioral and physiological responses to the environment, and establishes important incompatibilities in 'life stages'. Thus, it provides a model for studying special connections between physiology and life history [19]. What do we mean by life history? Life history is commonly defined as a set of evolved strategies, including behavioral, physiological and anatomical adaptations, that more or less influence survival and reproductive success directly. The reaction norm, or phenotypic response to environmental variation, is usually included in the definition of life history. As adaptations, life-history traits should be distinguished clearly from the life-table variables, such as birth rates and death rates, which they influence. Life tables vary greatly among populations, but only part of this variation reflects adaptive life-history responses to the environment. In general, it has been difficult to partition adaptation The rate of reproduction, age at maturity and longevity vary widely among species. Most of this life-history variation falls on a slow-fast continuum, with low reproductive rate, slow development and long life span at one end and the opposite traits at the other end. The absence of alternative combinations of these variables implies constraint on the diversification of life histories, but the nature of this constraint remains elusive. Here, we argue that individual and adaptive responses to different environments are limited by physiological mechanisms. Although energy and materials allocations are important results of physiological tradeoffs, endocrine control mechanisms can produce incompatible physiological states that restrict life histories to a single dominant axis of variation. To approach the problem of life-history variation properly, studies should integrate behavior and physiology within the environmental and demographic contexts of selection.},

	doi = {10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00572},
	abstract = {Neuro-parasitology is an emerging branch of science that deals with parasites that can control the nervous system of the host. It offers the possibility of discovering how one species (the parasite) modifies a particular neural network, and thus particular behaviors, of another species (the host). Such parasite-host interactions, developed over millions of years of evolution, provide unique tools by which one can determine how neuromodulation up-or-down regulates specific behaviors. In some of the most fascinating manipulations, the parasite taps into the host brain neuronal circuities to manipulate hosts cognitive functions. To name just a few examples, some worms induce crickets and other terrestrial insects to commit suicide in water, enabling the exit of the parasite into an aquatic environment favorable to its reproduction. In another example of behavioral manipulation, ants that consumed the secretions of a caterpillar containing dopamine are less likely to move away from the caterpillar and more likely to be aggressive. This benefits the caterpillar for without its ant bodyguards, it is more likely to be predated upon or attacked by parasitic insects that would lay eggs inside its body. Another example is the parasitic wasp, which induces a guarding behavior in its ladybug host in collaboration with a viral mutualist. To exert long-term behavioral manipulation of the host, parasite must secrete compounds that act through secondary messengers and/or directly on genes often modifying gene expression to produce long-lasting effects.},

	abstract = {The observation that certain species of parasite may adaptively manipulate its host behaviour is a fascinating phenomenon. As a result, the recently established field of 'host manipulation' has seen rapid expansion over the past few decades with public and scientific interest steadily increasing. However, progress appears to falter when researchers ask how parasites manipulate behaviour, rather than why. A vast majority of the published literature investigating the mechanistic basis underlying behavioural manipulation fails to connect the establishment of the parasite with the reported physiological changes in its host. This has left researchers unable to empirically distinguish/ identify adaptive physiological changes enforced by the parasites from pathological side effects of infection, resulting in scientists relying on narratives to explain results, rather than empirical evidence. By contrasting correlative mechanistic evidence for host manipulation against rare cases of causative evidence and drawing from the advanced understanding of physiological systems from other disciplines it is clear we are often skipping over a crucial step in host-manipulation: the production, potential storage, and release of molecules (manipulation factors) that must create the observed physiological changes in hosts if they are adaptive. Identifying these manipulation factors, via associating gene expression shifts in the parasite with behavioural changes in the host and following their effects will provide researchers with a bottom-up approach to unraveling the mechanisms of behavioural manipulation and by extension behaviour itself.},

Population dynamic models used by the International Whaling Commission require historical catch records, estimates of intrinsic rates of increase and current abundance, all of which are subject to considerable uncertainty. Population genetic parameters can be used for independent estimates of historical demography, but also have large uncertainty, particularly for rates of mutational substitution and gene flow. At present, demographic and genetic estimates of pre-exploitation abundance differ by an order of magnitude and, consequently, suggest vastly different baselines for judging recovery. Here, we review these two approaches and suggest the need for a synthetic analytical framework to evaluate uncertainty in key parameters. Such a framework could have broad application to modelling both historical and contemporary population dynamics in other exploited species.},

	abstract = {Recently developed capture-mark-recapture methods allow us to account for capture heterogeneity among individuals in the form of discrete mixtures and continuous individual random effects. In this article, we used simulations and two case studies to evaluate the effectiveness of continuously distributed individual random effects at removing potential bias due to capture heterogeneity, and to evaluate in what situation the added complexity of these models is justified. Simulations and case studies showed that ignoring individual capture heterogeneity generally led to a small negative bias in survival estimates and that individual random effects effectively removed this bias. As expected, accounting for capture heterogeneity also led to slightly less precise survival estimates. Our case studies also showed that accounting for capture heterogeneity increased in importance towards the end of study. Though ignoring capture heterogeneity led to a small bias in survival estimates, such bias may greatly impact management decisions. We advocate reducing potential heterogeneity at the sampling design stage. Where this is insufficient, we recommend modelling individual capture heterogeneity in situations such as when a large proportion of the individuals has a low detection probability (e.g. in the presence of floaters) and situations where the most recent survival estimates are of great interest (e.g. in applied conservation).},

These problems would disappear if, in its early history, the universe supercooled to temperatures 28 or more orders of magnitude below the critical temperature for some phase transition. A huge expansion factor would then result from a period of exponential growth, and the entropy of the universe would be multiplied by a huge factor when the latent heat is released. Such a scenario is completely natural in the context of grand unified models of elementary-particle interactions. In such models, the supercooling is also relevant to the problem of monopole suppression. Unfortunately, the scenario seems to lead to some unacceptable consequences, so modifications must be sought.},
