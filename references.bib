Experimental ecologists could also be divided into those who do not see any problems with sacrificing spatial and temporal scales in order to obtain replication, and those who understand that appropriate scale must always have priority over replication. If an experiment is conducted in a spatial or temporal scale, where the predictions of contesting hypotheses are convergent or ambiguous, no amount of technical impeccability can make the work instructive. Conversely, replication can always be obtained afterwards, by conducting more experiments with basically similar design in different areas and by using meta-analysis. This approach even reduces the sampling bias obtained if resources are allocated to a small number of well-replicated experiments. For a strict advocate of the hypothetico-deductive method, replication is unnecessary even as a matter of principle, unless the predicted response is so weak that random background noise is a plausible excuse for a discrepancy between predictions and results. By definition, a prediction is an 'all- statement', referring to all systems within a well-defined category. What applies to all must apply to any. Hence, choosing two systems and assigning them randomly to a treatment and a control is normally an adequate design for a deductive experiment. The strength of such experiments depends on the firmness of the predictions and their a priori probability of corroboration. Replication is but one of many ways of reducing this probability. Whether the experiment is replicated or not, inferential statistics should always be used, to enable the reader to judge how well the apparent patterns in samples reflect real patterns in statistical populations.

abstract = {Alpine zones are threatened globally by invasive species, hunting, and habitat loss caused by fire, anthropogenic development and climate change. These global threats are pertinent in New Zealand, with the least understood pressure being the potential impacts of introduced mammalian predators, the focus of this review. In New Zealand, alpine zones include an extensive suite of cold climate ecosystems covering c. 11{\%} of the land mass. They support rich communities of indigenous invertebrates, lizards, fish, and birds. Many taxa are obligate alpine dwellers, though there is uncertainty about the extent to which distributions of some species are relicts of wider historical ranges. The impacts of introduced mammalian predators are well described in many New Zealand ecosystems, though little is known about the impacts of these predators on alpine fauna. Here we review the importance of alpine habitats for indigenous fauna and the impacts of introduced mammalian predators; and develop a conceptual model explaining threat interactions. Most evidence for predation is anecdotal or comes from studies of species with wider ranges and at lower altitudes. Nevertheless, at least ten introduced predator species have been confirmed as frequent predators ofnative alpine species, particularly among birds and invertebrates. In the case of the endangered takahe (Porphyrio hochstetteri) and rock wren (Xenicus gilviventris), stoats (Mustela erminea) are primary predators, which are likely to be impacting significantly on population viability. We also document records of mammalian predation on alpine lizards and freshwater fish. While the precise impacts on the long-teen viability of threatened species have not been evaluated, anecdotal evidence suggests that predation by mammals is a serious threat, warranting predator control. Future research should focus on predicting when and where mammalian predators impact on populations of indigenous fauna, furthering our understanding of the alpine predator guild particularly through adaptive management experiments, and exploring interactions with other threats.},

abstract = {Capture-recapture studies are widely used to obtain information about abundance (population size or density) of animal populations. A common design is that in which multiple distinct populations are sampled, and the research objective is modeling variation in population size {\$}N{\_}{\{}s{\}}; s=1,2,...,S{\$} among the populations such as estimating a treatment effect or some other source of variation related to landscape structure. The problem is naturally resolved using hierarchical models. We provide a Bayesian formulation of such models using data augmentation which preserves the individual encounter histories in the model and, as such, is amenable to modeling individual effects. We formulate the model by conditioning on the total population size among all populations. In this case, the abundance model can be formulated as a multinomial model that allocates individuals among sites. MCMC is easily carried out by the introduction of a categorical individual effect, {\$}g{\_}{\{}i{\}}{\$}, which partitions the total population size. The prior distribution for the latent variable {\$}g{\$} is derived from the model assumed for the population sizes {\$}N{\_}{\{}s{\}}{\$}.},

abstract = {Implementing ecosystem-based fisheries management requires indicators and models that address the impacts of fishing across entire ecological communities. However, the complexity of many ecosystems presents a challenge to analysis, especially if reliant on quantification because of the onerous task of precisely measuring or estimating numerous parameters. We present qualitative modelling as a complementary approach to quantitative methods. Qualitative modelling clarifies how community structure alone affects dynamics, here of exploited populations. We build an array of models that describe different ecosystems with different harvesting practices, and analyse them to predict responses to various perturbations. This approach demonstrates the utility of qualitative modelling as a means to identify and interpret community-level indicators for systems that are at or near equilibrium, and for those that are frequently perturbed away from equilibrium. Examining the interaction of ecological and socio-economic variables associated with commercial fisheries provides an understanding of the main feedbacks that drive and regulate exploited ecosystems. The method is particularly useful for systems where the basic relationships between variables are understood but where precise or detailed data are lacking.},

abstract = {We analyzed seed production of mountain beech (Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortioides) forest along an elevational gradient in New Zealand from 1020 to 1370 m (treeline) for the years 1973-2002. We used seed production data from nine elevations and a site- and species-specific net carbon (C) availability model from two elevations (1050 in and 1340 IT) to examine how three variables (temperature, soil moisture, and net C availability) during three key periods (resource priming, flowering primordia development, and flowering) influence seed production. These three strongly interrelated variables have all been considered determinants of seed production but have not previously been tested together in a single analysis. Seed production increased over the 30-year period, with the greatest increases at high elevations; this increase was driven by a greater frequency of intermediate- sized seeding years. We then determined how temperature, soil moisture, and net C availability determined seeding, and examined whether temporal trends in the seeding data could be linked to similar temporal trends in temperature, soil moisture, or net C availability. High seed production was related to cool summers with high soil moisture during resource priming, warm summers during flower primordia development, and low net C availability during flowering. Positive temporal trends in temperatures during the period of flower primordia development accounted for the increase in seed production, suggesting that increasing temperatures are promoting more frequent seed production at high elevations.},

abstract = {Fluctuating populations of small mammals provide an excellent opportunity to study the functional and numerical responses of predators because of the wide range in prey density that occurs. I reinterpret data from six studies that have examined the role of predation in the population dynamics of votes in California, southern Sweden and western Finland, of snowshoe hares in northern Canada, and of house mice and rabbits in Australia. Most studies have measured functional responses by relying on changes in diet as reflected by seat or stomach contents. These methods are probably biased toward showing predator satiation. Contrary to previous conclusions I find that there is little evidence for non-linear (Type III) functional-response curves or predator satiation at high prey densities. Recent studies indicate that the functional and numerical responses of predators can be rapid and strong enough to initiate cyclic declines, dampen fluctuations, or even cause stable numbers. The exception to this appears to be the irruptions of mice and rabbits in Australia. I propose a general explanation for the role of predation whereby the effect of predation is largely dependent on the entire prey community. When potentially cyclic prey are a small component of the overall prey biomass, generalist predators are able to prevent fluctuations by strong functional or numerical responses. As the prey community becomes dominated by a few species that fluctuate, limit cycles predominate. Limit cycles turn into irruptive population dynamics when seasonal prey reproduction is eliminated because of extended periods of vegetation growth (vegetation flushes following drought). In the future we must test assumptions underlying the way we study predation by telemetric monitoring of prey mortality and by experimentally manipulating predation.},

The models are based on regression relationships at different levels, with the first level corresponding to the individual data and subsequent levels corresponding to between-group regressions of individual predictor effects on grouping unit variables. We present an approach to defining R2 at each level of the multilevel model, rather than attempting to create a single summary measure of fit. Our method is based on comparing variances in a single fitted model rather than with a null model. In simple regression, our measure generalizes the classical adjusted R2. We also discuss ...},

Population models show that these levels of predation are sufficient to cause population decreases. Unlike many other islands, mice are the only introduced mammals on Gough Island. However, restoration programmes to eradicate rats and other introduced mammals from islands are increasing the number of islands where mice are the sole alien mammals.

The recent initiation of Mainland Island projects constitutes an important step in that ecosystem-focused restoration goals are being pursued at mainland sites. The intensity and scope of pest control undertaken at Mainland Islands is greater than has normally been the case previously, as has been monitoring of results and conservation outcomes. Preliminary results suggest that declines in monitored species have been arrested and ecological processes revitalised. In addition to restoring values at individual sites Mainland Islands may be important places where our capacity to manage ecosystems more generally may be developed. Advances in our understanding of ecological processes and of responses to management using sound scientific procedures as part of operational programmes could lead to improved predictions to underpin management decisions. Refinements to management techniques and the development of appropriate skills, as well as enhancing public support and involvement could also be expected to have major benefits for conservation management more widely. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

State-space models are partitioned into an underlying system process describing the transitions of the true states of the system over time and the observation process linking the observations of the system to the true states. Open population capture–recapture–recovery data can be modelled in this framework by regarding the system process as the state of each individual observed within the study in terms of being alive or dead, and the observation process the recapture and/or recovery pro- cess. The traditional observation error of a state-space model is incorporated via the recapture/recovery probabilities being less than unity. The models can be fitted using a Bayesian data augmentation approach and in standard BUGS packages. Applying this state-space framework to such data permits additional complexities including individual het- erogeneity to be fitted to the data at very little additional programming effort. We consider the efficiency of the state-space model fitting approach by considering a random effects model for capture–recapture data relating to dippers and compare different Bayesian model-fitting algorithms within WinBUGS.},

Hole-nesting forest birds are particularly vulnerable to predation because they display few predator-avoidance behaviours. Mohua (Molnia ochrocephala) and parakeets are especially at risk because they nest when stoat (Mustela erminea) numbers in the forest are highest, and, because only females incubate, nest predation causes a biassed sex ratio. The Department of Conservation's hole-nesting birds and predator research programme aims to investigate three questions: (1) Are contemporary predators still having a significant impact on the long-term viability of forest bird populations? (2) Can we predict when predators will affect forest bird populations? (3) Can we increase the productivity and viability of forest bird populations by controlling predators? Mohua and yellow-crowned parakeets were used as indicator species to answer these questions, and the resulting eight studies are briefly outlined.},

abstract = {Eradications of invasive species often have striking positive effects on native biota.However, recent research has shown that species removal in isolation can also result in unexpected changes to other ecosystem components.These secondary effects will become more likely as numbers of interacting invaders increase in ecosystems,and as exotics in late stages of invasion eliminate native species and replace their functional roles. Food web and functional role frameworks can be used to identify ecological conditions that forecast the potential for unwanted secondary impacts. Integration of eradication into a holistic process of assessment and restoration will help safeguard against accidental,adverse effects on native ecosystems.},

abstract = {A computer model of the population dynamics of introduced house mice (Mus musculus L.), ship rats (Rattus rattus L.) and stoats (Mustela erminea L.) in New Zealand forest was constructed, to test the relative importance of food availability and predation in shaping observed small-mammal population dynamics. Ship rats and mice are the two common rodent species present in most New Zealand forests, and exhibit eruptive population dynamics. Stoats are the only common mammalian predator, and undergo large density fluctuations following periodic rodent eruptions. A number of outputs and predictions from the model were developed. The model highlights the overall importance of variation in food availability in determining the timing and amplitude of rodent population eruptions. It indicates that predators can not prevent a prey-species eruption, primarily due to differences in reproductive biology. Predation however, can delay the start of the prey-population increase during the eruption. The role of predators in limiting the peak prey-population size will depend on the size of the energy input. In a full-scale eruption following maximal tree seeding, predators cannot significantly truncate peak prey-population size. Predators should be able to significantly hasten the rate of decline in the prey populations, although the strength of predator limitation will depend on the severity of food limitation and cold-induced mortality over the same period. Predators can limit prey populations during the post-crash low phase. As with the crash phase, the strength of predator limitation in the low phase will depend on the severity of food limitation and natural mortality. The model highlights gaps in current knowledge of predator and prey species biology and ecology. The model highlights key areas where further field study should provide a better understanding of the factors driving small-mammal communities in New Zealand. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Management agencies and quantitative ecologists need robust estimates of population density. The best way of converting population estimates of livetrapped small mammals to population density is not clear. We estimated population density on livetrapping grids with 4 estimators applied to 3 species of boreal forest and 3 species of tundra rodents to test for relative differences in density estimators. We used 2 spatial estimators proposed by Efford (2009) and 2 traditional boundary-strip estimators designed for grid livetrapping. We analyzed mark–recapture data from 104 trapping sessions from the boreal forest at Kluane, Yukon (n  =  4,818 individuals), and 56 trapping sessions from tundra areas of Herschel Island and Komakuk Beach in northern Yukon (n  =  1,327 individuals). For boreal forest rodents on average both boundary-strip methods produced density estimates larger than Efford's maximum-likelihood (ML) estimator by as much as 50{\%} at all population densities up to 25 animals/ha. For tundra rodents both boundary-strip methods produced density estimates smaller than Efford's ML at low density ({\textless}1.5/ha) and larger than Efford's ML density by 36–63{\%} at high density (25/ha). Efford's inverse prediction estimator produced larger density estimates than the ML estimator by 4{\%} for the boreal forest and 32{\%} for the tundra rodents. Relationships were high between all the estimators, such that trends in density could be inferred from all methods. Determining the bias in population density estimators in small mammals will require data from populations spatially closed and completely enumerated. For our small mammals Efford's ML estimator typically provided density estimates smaller than those produced by conventional boundary-strip estimators.},

abstract = {Implementing ecosystem-based fisheries management requires indicators and models that address the impacts of fishing across entire ecological communities. However, the complexity of many ecosystems presents a challenge to analysis, especially if reliant on quantification because of the onerous task of precisely measuring or estimating numerous parameters. We present qualitative modelling as a complementary approach to quantitative methods. Qualitative modelling clarifies how community structure alone affects dynamics, here of exploited populations. We build an array of models that describe different ecosystems with different harvesting practices, and analyse them to predict responses to various perturbations. This approach demonstrates the utility of qualitative modelling as a means to identify and interpret community-level indicators for systems that are at or near equilibrium, and for those that are frequently perturbed away from equilibrium. Examining the interaction of ecological and socio-economic variables associated with commercial fisheries provides an understanding of the main feedbacks that drive and regulate exploited ecosystems. The method is particularly useful for systems where the basic relationships between variables are understood but where precise or detailed data are lacking.},

abstract = {Fluctuating populations of small mammals provide an excellent opportunity to study the functional and numerical responses of predators because of the wide range in prey density that occurs. I reinterpret data from six studies that have examined the role of predation in the population dynamics of votes in California, southern Sweden and western Finland, of snowshoe hares in northern Canada, and of house mice and rabbits in Australia. Most studies have measured functional responses by relying on changes in diet as reflected by seat or stomach contents. These methods are probably biased toward showing predator satiation. Contrary to previous conclusions I find that there is little evidence for non-linear (Type III) functional-response curves or predator satiation at high prey densities. Recent studies indicate that the functional and numerical responses of predators can be rapid and strong enough to initiate cyclic declines, dampen fluctuations, or even cause stable numbers. The exception to this appears to be the irruptions of mice and rabbits in Australia. I propose a general explanation for the role of predation whereby the effect of predation is largely dependent on the entire prey community. When potentially cyclic prey are a small component of the overall prey biomass, generalist predators are able to prevent fluctuations by strong functional or numerical responses. As the prey community becomes dominated by a few species that fluctuate, limit cycles predominate. Limit cycles turn into irruptive population dynamics when seasonal prey reproduction is eliminated because of extended periods of vegetation growth (vegetation flushes following drought). In the future we must test assumptions underlying the way we study predation by telemetric monitoring of prey mortality and by experimentally manipulating predation.},

abstract = {In many forested ecosystems, the architecture and functional ecology of certain tree species define forest structure and their species-specific traits control ecosystem dynamics. Such foundation tree species are declining throughout the world due to introductions and outbreaks of pests and pathogens, selective removal of individual taxa, and over-harvesting. Through a series of case studies, we show that the loss of foundation tree species changes the local environment on which a variety of other species depend; how this disrupts fundamental ecosystem processes, including rates of decomposition, nutrient fluxes, carbon sequestration, and energy flow; and dramatically alters the dynamics of associated aquatic ecosystems. Forests in which dynamics are controlled by one or a few foundation species appear to be dominated by a small number of strong interactions and may be highly susceptible to alternating between stable states following even small perturbations. The ongoing decline of many foundation species provides a set of important, albeit unfortunate, opportunities to develop the research tools, models, and metrics needed to identify foundation species, anticipate the cascade of immediate, short- and long-term changes in ecosystem structure and function that will follow from their loss, and provide options for remedial conservation and management.},

abstract = {Repeatability (more precisely the common measure of repeatability, the intra-class correlation coefficient, ICC) is an important index for quantifying the accuracy of measurements and the constancy of phenotypes. It is the proportion of phenotypic variation that can be attributed to between-subject (or between-group) variation. As a consequence, the non-repeatable fraction of phenotypic variation is the sum of measurement error and phenotypic flexibility. There are several ways to estimate repeatability for Gaussian data, but there are no formal agreements on how repeatability should be calculated for non-Gaussian data (e.g. binary, proportion and count data). In addition to point estimates, appropriate uncertainty estimates (standard errors and confidence intervals) and statistical significance for repeatability estimates are required regardless of the types of data. We review the methods for calculating repeatability and the associated statistics for Gaussian and non-Gaussian data. For Gaussian data, we present three common approaches for estimating repeatability: correlation-based, analysis of variance (ANOVA)-based and linear mixed-effects model (LMM)-based methods, while for non-Gaussian data, we focus on generalised linear mixed-effects models (GLMM) that allow the estimation of repeatability on the original and on the underlying latent scale. We also address a number of methods for calculating standard errors, confidence intervals and statistical significance; the most accurate and recommended methods are parametric bootstrapping, randomisation tests and Bayesian approaches. We advocate the use of LMM-and GLMM-based approaches mainly because of the ease with which confounding variables can be controlled for. Furthermore, we compare two types of repeatability (ordinary repeatability and extrapolated repeatability) in relation to narrow-sense heritability. This review serves as a collection of guidelines and recommendations for biologists to calculate repeatability and heritability from both Gaussian and non-Gaussian data.},

A surge of interest in this area was catalyzed by the observation that evolution by natural selection can operate at the same contemporary timescales as ecological dynamics. Specifically, recent eco-evolutionary research focuses on how rapid adaptation influences ecology, and vice versa. Evolution by non-adaptive forces also occurs quickly, with ecological consequences, but understanding the full scope of ecology–evolution (eco–evo) interactions requires explicitly addressing population-level processes – genetic and demographic. We show the strong ecological effects of non-adaptive evolutionary forces and, more broadly, the value of population-level research for gaining a mechanistic understanding of eco–evo interactions.

abstract = {Although indirect effects are important structuring forces in ecological communities, they are seldom considered in the design of pest control operations. However, such effects may cause unpredicted and deleterious changes in other populations that could reduce or even negate the benefit to endangered species for which control is undertaken. Furthermore, the complexity and nonlinearities inherent in interacting ecological communities may cause thresholds in the strength of pest control, on either side of which indirect effects could vary greatly in their magnitude and desirability. We constructed a four-species simulation model for a common pest community in New Zealand beech (Nothofagus spp.) forests: house mice, ship rats, stoats, and brushtail possums. When the model was perturbed to simulate common control techniques, marked increases in the abundance of nontarget pest species were observed at the next forest mast. Higher mouse numbers were observed following both toxin (1080) application and rat kill-trapping, and higher rat numbers were observed following stoat kill-trapping, due to a release from predation in all cases. In comparison, a marked decrease in stoat abundance at the next forest mast was observed following simultaneous control of rats and mice, due to the effects of decreased prey abundance on the stoat population. For rat control, the size of the indirect effect on mouse numbers increased monotonically with control strength. Because the curvature of the relationship is slight, the relationship between the direct benefits of control and the indirect costs incurred would remain relatively unchanged regardless of the strength of control employed. For simultaneous mouse and rat control, however, high levels of control (as initially simulated) were predicted to cause decreased peak stoat abundance at the next mast event, whereas intermediate and low levels of control were predicted to cause increased stoat abundance. Hence, this study demonstrates two points of concern for pest managers. First, indirect effects of control operations do have the potential to reduce the planned-for benefit.

abstract = {'Bait-resistance' is defined as progressive decreases in bait efficacy in controlled pest species populations. Understanding the mechanisms by which bait-resistance can develop is important for the sustainable control of pests worldwide, for both wildlife conservation programs and agricultural production. Bait-resistance is influenced by both behavioural (innate and learned bait-avoidance behaviour) and physiological aspects of the target pest species (its natural diet, its body mass, the mode of action of the toxin, and the animal's ability to biochemically break down the toxin). In this review, we summarise the scientific literature, discuss factors that can lead to innate and learned aversion to baits, as well as physiological tolerance. We address the question of whether bait avoidance or tolerance to 1080 could develop in the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), an introduced predator of significant economic and environmental importance in Australia. Sublethal poisoning has been identified as the primary cause of both bait avoidance and increased toxin-tolerance, and so, finally, we provide examples of how management actions can minimise the risk of sublethal baits in pest species populations.},

A combination of mitochondrial (mt) D-loop DNA sequences, nuclear DNA data, external measurements and skull characteristics shows that house mice (Mus musculus) in New Zealand and its outlying islands are descended from very diverse sources. The predominant genome is Mus musculus domesticus (from western Europe), but Mus musculus musculus (from central Europe) and Mus musculus castaneus (from southern Asia) are also represented genetically. These subspecies have hybridized to produce combinations of musculus and domesticus nuclear DNA coupled with domesticus mtDNA, and castaneus or musculus mtDNA with domesticus nuclear DNA. The majority of the mice with domesticus mtDNA that we sampled had D-loop sequences identical to two haplotypes common in Britain. This is consistent with long-term British-New Zealand cultural linkages. The origins of the castaneus mtDNA sequences widespread in New Zealand are less easy to identify.},

abstract = {In 2016, the New Zealand Government announced a policy to rid the country of key introduced predators (possums (Trichosurus vulpecula), ship rats (Rattus rattus), Norway rats (R. norvegicus) and mustelids (Mustela spp.)) by 2050. An interim goal under this policy is to remove all mammalian predators (the key species as well as mice (Mus musculus), kiore (R. exulans), cats (Felis catus), pigs (Sus scrofa) and hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus)) from island nature reserves by 2025. We identify the New Zealand islands over one hectare managed as reserves by the Department of Conservation (DOC) that have mammalian predators that can be eradicated. There are over 850 islands, islets, stacks and vegetated rocks in the New Zealand archipelago. We exclude islands in lakes and rivers and those smaller than one hectare, which leaves 616 islands, less than half of which are under some form of reserve status (286 islands entirely managed by DOC and 13 under mixed tenures but with some reserve land). One or more mammalian predators are known to occur on 48 of these islands, with the Government's 2050 target species on 42 islands and other predators (in the absence of the target species) on six islands. The Government's 2025 goal nominates one class of reserve, nature reserves. Of the 48 islands, just four islands are classed as nature reserves – two (Mauitaha and Araara Islands) with protected kiore in the Hen and Chickens group and two in the Auckland Islands group (Auckland with mice, cats and pigs; and Masked with mice and cats) – i.e. none with the key species of the wider 2050 goal. Therefore, we consider other reserve classes but place more or less strict risks of reinvasion, as indexed by known swimming ranges of the predators, to judge the feasibility of eradication. Relaxing the reserve class of the island, but not our selection of swimming ranges, results in 15 candidate islands where all mammalian predators present could be eradicated for the 2025 interim goal. Decisions on which islands to select for the programme need to consider costs and other constraints to eradicate different combinations of predators, and whether the island and its predators provide templates for the wider vision of a predator-free New Zealand, i.e. whether any of the key 2050 predators are present, the size of the island, and/or the presence of human inhabitants that complicate the predators to be targeted or constrain the use of some control methods.},

abstract = {Predator-prey communities are ubiquitous in ecology, but introduced predators can drive native species to extinction within island systems, prompting the eradication of such exotics. Ecological theory predicts that elimination of top-introduced predators from islands can lead to the counterintuitive decline of native prey populations through the ecological release of smaller introduced species in a process termed "mesopredator release." We show, in accordance with mesopredator release theory and counter to conservation goals for a New Zealand island reserve, that initial eradication of cats on Little Barrier Island led to reduced breeding success of Cook's petrels, which also are vulnerable to predation by a mesopredator, the Pacific rat. The rat's impact on prey productivity varied with elevation within the island. Rat eradication was followed by a rise in petrel productivity, in support of both ecological theory and practical conservation management goals. It appears that interactions among introduced predators, native prey, and environmental gradients can drive counterintuitive and spatially heterogeneous responses to predator eradications from islands. Location-specific, ecosystem-level understanding is essential for predicting the outcomes of such restoration management techniques.},

abstract = {The population dynamics of ship rats (Rattus rattus L.) were studied in podocarp/hardwood and hard beech (Nothofagus truncata) forest in the Orongorongo Valley, near Wellington, from 1971 to 1998. Rat density (indexed by captures in 116 snap traps over 3 nights per quarter) varied up to five-fold between consecutive years. Fruiting of hinau (Elaeocarpus dentatus) and hard beech did not drive the fluctuations as had been suggested. Average density increased over the first 15 years of the study (from 2.3 {\^{A}}± 0.3 to 7.5 {\^{A}}± 0.8 per 100 trap-nights (mean {\^{A}}± SE)), and then declined; this mirrored a trend in cat density driven by external factors. Breeding was largely restricted to spring (November) and summer (February). Breeding rate (proportion pregnant or lactating) was density-dependent, particularly in older rats. Litter size (based on live embryos and new uterine scars) increased between spring (4.4 {\^{A}}± 0.4) and summer (5.5 {\^{A}}± 0.3) (mean {\^{A}}± SE), but did not vary with density or age. Winter breeding was rare (2{\%} pregnant or lactating in August). Hinau fruitfall did not predict the proportion breeding in autumn (May), or survival in winter-spring (i.e., population change between August and November). Varying predation intensity was the most likely explanation for the population trend. We review other New Zealand studies and question the assumption that ship rat populations are "eruptive", except possibly when predation is eliminated. {\^{A}}{\textcopyright} The Royal Society of New Zealand 2006.},

abstract = {(1) There was a significant relationship between seedfall and populations of mice in all forests studied. Good seedfalls were followed by increases in density of mice and changes in population structure not seen in years when the seedfall failed. Predictability of these changes decreased with increasing diversity of forest composition. (2) Stoats responded both numerically and functionally to increases in mice. There was a significant relationship between the densities of mice and of stoats in summer in two forests. (In a third, this relationship was modified by the presence nearby of many lagomorphs, an important alternative prey for stoats.) The numerical response was due to increased survival, in the uterus or the nest, of young stoats born in spring when mice were abundant, not to increased fecundity of adult female stoats. In all three forests, stoats ate significantly more mice in the summers that mice were abundant. (3) Ship rats (Rattus rattus (L.)) were most abundant in the most diverse of the three forests. The density index for R. rattus increased there after the 1976 seedfall, but not after that of 1979. A few kiore (R. exulans (Peale)) coexisted with R. rattus in this forest. (4) Stoats did not eat significantly fewer birds when there were plenty of mice, either in summer or autumn, but nevertheless there was a significant negative correlation between the proportions of birds and mice in the diet in autumn. In summer this correlation was very weak and probably non-existent. (5) A `bird predation index', which takes into account both the numbers of stoats present and what they ate, suggests that more birds are eaten in summers of peak numbers of mice and stoats, because of the strong numerical response by stoats to mice and lack of `buffering' of birds by mice. In autumn this effect is weakened by a regular seasonal switch by stoats from birds to mice, especially in the autumn of a mouse peak year. (6) The indirect effects of mouse irruptions on populations of forest birds in New Zealand should be further examined. Control of stoats in mouse peak summers could prevent a temporary increase in predation on birds by stoats during the highest risk period, though whether this would benefit the birds is unknown.

I radio-tracked rats of both species from June 1996 to September 1996, when the first of two aerial poison drops occurred. The aim of the study was to describe the home-range parameters of both species of rat in an area of grassland where they coexisted. Radio-tagged kiore occupied overlapping home ranges that varied from 26 to 89 m in diameter. Norway rats occupied larger home ranges (218–916 m in diameter), which overlapped the home ranges of both other Norway rats and kiore. Jacobs' indices of cohesiveness indicated that kiore and Norway rats might avoid each other, despite the fact that their home ranges overlapped. Patterns of habitat use suggest that kiore prefer denser habitats than Norway rats. Differing habitat preferences, possibly driven by higher predation risk for kiore in open habitats, might be sufficient to explain coexistence of rodents on Kapiti Island. Further research is needed to elucidate the relative importance of diet, home range use, and predation risk in permitting multi- species assemblages in New Zealand. Keywords:},

abstract = {Predicting the dynamics and impacts of multiple invasive species can be complex because ecological relationships, which occur among several trophic levels, are often incompletely understood. Further, the complexity of these trophic relationships exacerbates our inability to predict climate change effects on invaded ecosystems. We explore the hypothesis that interactions between two global change drivers, invasive vertebrates and climate change, will potentially make matters worse for native biodiversity. In New Zealand beech (Nothofagus spp.) forests, a highly irruptive invasive mammal community is driven by multi-annual resource pulses of beech seed (masting). Because mast frequency is predicted to increase with climate change, we use this as a model system to explore the extent to which such effects may influence invasive vertebrate communities, and the implications of such interactions for native biodiversity and its management. We build on an established model of trophic interactions in the system, combining it with a logistic probability mast function, the parameters of which were altered to simulate either contemporary conditions or conditions of more or less frequent masting. The model predicts that increased mast frequency will lead to populations of a top predator (the stoat) and a mesopredator (the ship rat) becoming less irruptive and being maintained at appreciably higher average abundances in this forest type. In addition, the ability of both current and in-development management approaches to suppress invasive mammals is predicted to be compromised. Because invasive mammals are key drivers of native fauna extinction in New Zealand, with the additional loss of associated functions such as pollination and seed dispersal, these predictions imply potentially serious adverse impacts of climate change for the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem function. Our study also highlights the importance of long-term monitoring data for assessing and managing future impacts of global change drivers.},

abstract = {Introduced vertebrate predators are one of the most important threats to endemic species throughout a range of ecosystems, in particular on islands in biodiversity hot spots. Consequently, the reduction of predator numbers is considered a key conservation action in the management of many native vertebrates vulnerable to predators. It is now established that control attempts may affect non-target species through trophic interactions, but little is known concerning their consequences on competitive relationships. We study a mathematical model mimicking the effects of controlling introduced species in the presence of their competitors.We used two competing rodents to illustrate our study: black rats, Rattus rattus, and mice, Mus musculus. Analyses of the model show that control of only one introduced species logically results in the dramatic increase of the overlooked competitor.We present empirical data that confirm our theoretical predictions. Less intuitively, this process, which we term ‘the competitor release effect', may also occur when both introduced competitors are simultaneously controlled. In our setting, controlling both predators can promote their coexistence. This occurs as soon as the inferior competitor benefits from the differential effect of the simultaneous control of both competitors, that is, when the indirect positive effect of control (the removal of their competitors) exceeds its direct negative effect (their own removal). Both control levels and target specificity have a direct influence on the extent of this process: counter-intuitively, the stronger and more specific the control, the greater the effect.The theoretical validation of the competitor release effect has important implications in conservation, especially for control management.

Increasingly, these eradications are contested by activists claiming moral, legal, cultural, historic or scientific reasons and poorly documented evidence of effects. We reviewed the global literature on the effects of rats on island flora and fauna. We then used New Zealand as a case study because of its four-decade history of rat eradications and many detailed and innovative studies of how rats affect native species. These include use of exclosures, local manipulations of rat populations, video surveillance, and measurements of responses following eradications. The most intensive studies have been on the Pacific rat (Rattus exulans), a small South-East Asian species spread by Polynesians throughout the Pacific. These and the more recently introduced Norway rat (R. norvegicus) and ship (roof) rat (R. rattus) suppress some forest plants, and are associated with extinctions or declines of flightless invertebrates, ground-dwelling reptiles, land birds, and burrowing seabirds. On islands off France, Norway rats are also implicated in declines of shrews. Globally, ship rats were associated with declines or extinctions of the largest number of indigenous vertebrate species (60), including small mammals such as deer mice and bats. Effects of rats on forest trees and seabird populations are sufficiently pervasive to affect ecosystem structure and function. However, the data are patchy. Deficiencies in our knowledge would be reduced by documenting distribution and abundance of indigenous species before and after eradications. Comprehensive measurements of the responses of indigenous species to rat eradications would enable the development of testable models of rat invasion effect},

abstract = {Populations of house mice were sampled on nine grids in Fiordland National Park between May and No- vember 1999, using live-capture and footprint-tracking tunnel methods. Trapped mice were removed from three grids (approximately 3.24 ha each), and marked and released on the other six. Density estimates were obtained using recapture data from the grids where mice were released (Mh (jackknife) model from program CAPTURE), and rate- of-capture data from grids where mice were removed (Mbh (removal) CAPTURE model). Density estimates were used to evaluate the performance of 4 indices of mouse abundance by contrasting R2-values of their regression on estimated mouse density. Indices evaluated were: minimum number of individuals known to be alive (MNA) (total number of individual mice caught over the course of a trapping session), one-night trap catch (number of mice caught on first night of each trapping session expressed as captures per 100 trap-nights), three-night trap catch (same index estimated from number of mice caught over the first three nights), and tracking-tunnel index (propor- tion of nine tunnels that had mouse tracks). While MNA, one-night trap catch, and three-night trap catch were all significantly correlated with estimated density, MNA was most strongly correlated, with R2 varying between 0.67 to 0.87 depending on whether 3, 4 or 5 nights' capture data were used. Variation in tracking-tunnel index was unre- lated to mouse density on our grids.},

Recently, Chandler and Royle (2013) presented an extension of$\backslash$na spatially explicit capture-recapture model that estimates population$\backslash$ndensity from spatially replicated counts in unmarked populations.

abstract = {Invasive species are the greatest threat to island ecosystems, which harbour nearly half the world's endangered biodiversity. However, eradication is more feasible on islands than on continents. We present a global analysis of 1,224 successful eradications of invasive plants and animals on 808 islands. Most involve single vertebrate species on uninhabited islands, but plant and invertebrate eradications occur more often on inhabited islands. Inhabited islands are often highly modified and support numerous introduced species. Consequently, targeting a single invasive species can be ineffective or counterproductive. The impacts of other pests will continue and, in some cases, be exacerbated. The presence of people also creates regulatory, logistical and socio-political constraints. Real or perceived health risks to inhabitants, pets and livestock may restrict the use of some eradication tools, and communities or individuals sometimes oppose eradication. Despite such challenges, managing invasive species is vital to conserve and restore the unique biodiversity of many inhabited islands, and to maintain or improve the welfare and livelihoods of island residents. We present a brief case study of the Juan Ferna´ndez Archipelago, Chile, and discuss the feasibility of eradicating large suites of invasive plants and animals from inhabited islands while managing other invaders for which eradication is not feasible or desirable. Eradications must be planned to account for species interactions. Monitoring and contingency plans must detect and address any ‘surprise effects'. Above all, it is important that the local community derives social, cultural and/or economic benefits, and that people support and are engaged in the restoration effort.},

abstract = {State-space models (SSMs) are increasingly used in ecology to model time-series such as animal movement paths and population dynamics. This type of hierarchical model is often structured to account for two levels of variability: biological stochasticity and measurement error. SSMs are flexible. They can model linear and nonlinear processes using a variety of statistical distributions. Recent ecological SSMs are often complex, with a large number of parameters to estimate. Through a simulation study, we show that even simple linear Gaussian SSMs can suffer from parameter- and state-estimation problems. We demonstrate that these problems occur primarily when measurement error is larger than biological stochasticity, the condition that often drives ecologists to use SSMs. Using an animal movement example, we show how these estimation problems can affect ecological inference. Biased parameter estimates of a SSM describing the movement of polar bears ($\backslash$textit{\{}Ursus maritimus{\}}) result in overestimating their energy expenditure. We suggest potential solutions, but show that it often remains difficult to estimate parameters. While SSMs are powerful tools, they can give misleading results and we urge ecologists to assess whether the parameters can be estimated accurately before drawing ecological conclusions from their results.},

@article{King1983,
abstract = {(1) There was a significant relationship between seedfall and populations of mice in all forests studied. Good seedfalls were followed by increases in density of mice and changes in population structure not seen in years when the seedfall failed. Predictability of these changes decreased with increasing diversity of forest composition. (2) Stoats responded both numerically and functionally to increases in mice. There was a significant relationship between the densities of mice and of stoats in summer in two forests. (In a third, this relationship was modified by the presence nearby of many lagomorphs, an important alternative prey for stoats.) The numerical response was due to increased survival, in the uterus or the nest, of young stoats born in spring when mice were abundant, not to increased fecundity of adult female stoats. In all three forests, stoats ate significantly more mice in the summers that mice were abundant. (3) Ship rats (Rattus rattus (L.)) were most abundant in the most diverse of the three forests. The density index for R. rattus increased there after the 1976 seedfall, but not after that of 1979. A few kiore (R. exulans (Peale)) coexisted with R. rattus in this forest. (4) Stoats did not eat significantly fewer birds when there were plenty of mice, either in summer or autumn, but nevertheless there was a significant negative correlation between the proportions of birds and mice in the diet in autumn. In summer this correlation was very weak and probably non-existent. (5) A `bird predation index', which takes into account both the numbers of stoats present and what they ate, suggests that more birds are eaten in summers of peak numbers of mice and stoats, because of the strong numerical response by stoats to mice and lack of `buffering' of birds by mice. In autumn this effect is weakened by a regular seasonal switch by stoats from birds to mice, especially in the autumn of a mouse peak year. (6) The indirect effects of mouse irruptions on populations of forest birds in New Zealand should be further examined. Control of stoats in mouse peak summers could prevent a temporary increase in predation on birds by stoats during the highest risk period, though whether this would benefit the birds is unknown.

abstract = {Although the co-occurrence of nonnative vertebrates is a ubiquitous global phenomenon, the study of interactions between invaders is poorly represented in the literature. Limited understanding of the interactions between co-occurring vertebrates can be problematic for predicting how the removal of only one invasive—a common management scenario—will affect native communities. We suggest a trophic food web framework for predicting the effects of single-species management on native biodi-versity. We used a literature search and meta-analysis to assess current understanding of how the removal of one invasive vertebrate affects native biodiversity relative to when two invasives are present. The majority of studies focused on the removal of carnivores, mainly within aquatic systems, which highlights a critical knowledge gap in our understanding of co-occurring invasive vertebrates. We found that removal of one invasive vertebrate caused a significant negative effect on native species compared to when two invasive vertebrates were present. These unexpected results could arise because of the positioning and hierarchy of the co-occurring invasives in the food web (e.g., carnivore–carnivore or carnivore–herbivore). We consider that there are important knowledge gaps to determinate the effects of multiple co-existing invaders on native ecosystems, and this information could be precious for management.},

abstract = {The distribution of native, chaparral-requiring bird species was determined for 37 isolated fragments of canyon habitat ranging in size from 0.4 to 104 hectares in coastal, urban San Diego County, California The area of chaparral habitat and canyon age (time since isolation of the habitat fragment) explains most of the variation in the number of chaparral-requiring bird species. In addition, the distribution of native predators may influence species num- ber. There is statistical evidence that coyotes control the pop- ulations of smaller predators such as foxes and domestic cats. The absence of coyotes may lead to higher levels of predation by a process of mesopredator release. The distance of canyons from other patches of chaparral habitat does not add significantly to the explained variance in chaparral- requiring species number-probably because of the virtual inability of most chaparral-requiring species to disperse through developed areas and nonscrub habitats. These re- sults and other lines of evidence suggest that chaparral- requiring birds in isolated canyons have very high rates of extinction, in part because of their low vagility. The best predictors of vulnerability of the individual species are their abundances (densities) in undisturbed habitat and their body sizes; together these two variables account for 95 per- cent of the variation in canyon occupancy. A hypothesis is proposed to account for the similarity between the steep slopes of species-area curves for chaparral-requiring birds and the slopes for some forest birds on small islands or in habitat fragments. The provision of corridors appears to be the most effective design and planning featuref or preventing the elimination of chaparral-requiring species in a fragmented landscape.},

abstract = {Integrated population models (IPMs) constitute a relatively new approach for estimating population trends and demographic parameters that makes use of multiple, independent data sources (e.g., count and mark-recapture data) within a unified statistical framework. In principle, IPMs offer several advantages over more conventional modeling approaches that rely on a single source of data, including greater precision in parameter estimates and the ability to estimate demographic parameters for which no explicit data are available. However, to date, the IPM literature has focused primarily on model development and evaluation, and few "real-world" applications have demonstrated that IPMs can strengthen inferences about population dynamics in a species of conservation concern. Here, we combined 23 years of count, occupancy, reproductive, and mark-recapture data into an IPM framework to estimate population trends and demographic rates in a population of California spotted owls (Strix occidentalis occidentalis). Using this framework, we observed a significant population decline, as evidenced by the geometric mean of the finite annual rate of population change (??t-??=0.969, 95{\%} CRI 0.957-0.980) and the resulting realized population change (proportion of the initial population present in 2012; ????2012=0.501, 95{\%} CRI 0.383-0.641). The estimated decline was considerably greater than the approximately 30{\%} decline estimated using conventional mark-recapture and occupancy approaches (Tempel and Guti??rrez, 2013). The IPM likely yielded a greater decline because it allowed for the inclusion of three years of data from the beginning of the study that were omitted from previous analyses to meet the assumptions of mark-recapture models. The IPM may also have yielded a greater estimate of decline than occupancy models owing to an increase in the number of territories occupied by single owls over the study period. All demographic parameters (adult and juvenile apparent survival, reproductive rate, immigration rate) were positively correlated with ??t??, but immigration was fairly high (immt??=0.097, 95{\%} CRI 0.055-0.140) and contributed most to temporal variation in ??t??, suggesting that changes in owl abundance were influenced by processes occurring outside of our study area. More broadly, our results indicated that the IPM framework has the potential to strengthen inference in population monitoring and demographic studies, particularly for those involving long-lived species whose abundance may be slowly declining. In our case, the conservation implications from the results of the IPM suggested a decline in the population of owls that was steeper than previously thought. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Richard Levins has advocated the scientific merits of qualitative model- ing throughout his career. He believed an excessive and uncritical focus on emu- lating the models used by physicists and maximizing quantitative precision was hindering biological theorizing in particular. Greater emphasis on qualitative properties of modeled systems would help counteract this tendency, and Levins subsequently developed one method of qualitative modeling, loop analysis, to study a wide variety of biological phenomena. Qualitative modeling has been criticized for being conceptually and methodologically problematic. As a clear example of a qualitative modeling method, loop analysis shows this criticism is indefensible. The method has, however, some serious limitations. This paper describes loop analysis, its limitations, and attempts to clarify the differences between quantitative and qualitative modeling, in content and objective. Loop analysis is but one of numerous types of qualitative analysis, so its limitations do not detract from the currently underappreciated and underdeveloped role qualitative modeling could have within science.},

abstract = {Control operations for invasive ship rats, Rattus rattus, in New Zealand forests are often followed by increased house mouse, Mus musculus, detections suggesting rats suppress mice. A potential mechanism is intraguild predation, either by interference competition or as simple predatory behaviour. If aggression by rats towards mice is mainly competitive, it should include threat and display features associated with, for example, intraspecific fighting. If predatory, it should lack these features and be associated with feeding. In the first of two captive experiments we observed interactions between paired, live rodents, either side of a wire-mesh screen, and found that most rats were aggressive to mice. This aggression lacked threat and display characteristics typical of encounters with conspecifics and was rarely reciprocated by mice. In a second experiment, euthanized mice were drawn by a line through cages occupied by rats fed either a restricted or unrestricted diet. Rats of both groups attacked and restrained the euthanized mice, and all rats that interacted with the mice ate at least part of them, although food-restricted rats tended to eat more. As the aggressive response of ship rats towards mice lacked threat and display features and was related to feeding, we conclude that it resembles predatory behaviour. Our findings provide a better understanding of the interactions between ship rats and house mice, which hinder their management where they coexist as damaging invaders. However, further research is required to determine whether the results of our captive experiments are consistent with wild rat behaviour. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract = {Biologists have long known that predators play a key role in structuring ecological communities, but recent research suggests that predator richness - the number of genotypes, species, and functional groups that comprise predator assemblages - can also have cascading effects on communities and ecosystem properties. Changes in predator richness, including the decreases resulting from extinctions and the increases resulting from exotic invasions, can alter the composition, diversity, and population dynamics of lower trophic levels. However, the magnitude and direction of these effects are highly variable and depend on environmental context and natural history, and so are difficult to predict. This is because species at higher trophic levels exhibit many indirect, non-additive, and behavioral interactions. The next steps in predator biodiversity research will be to increase experimental realism and to incorporate current knowledge about the functional role of predator richness into ecosystem management.},

abstract = {Integrated population models (IPMs) constitute a relatively new approach for estimating population trends and demographic parameters that makes use of multiple, independent data sources (e.g., count and mark-recapture data) within a unified statistical framework. In principle, IPMs offer several advantages over more conventional modeling approaches that rely on a single source of data, including greater precision in parameter estimates and the ability to estimate demographic parameters for which no explicit data are available. However, to date, the IPM literature has focused primarily on model development and evaluation, and few "real-world" applications have demonstrated that IPMs can strengthen inferences about population dynamics in a species of conservation concern. Here, we combined 23 years of count, occupancy, reproductive, and mark-recapture data into an IPM framework to estimate population trends and demographic rates in a population of California spotted owls (Strix occidentalis occidentalis). Using this framework, we observed a significant population decline, as evidenced by the geometric mean of the finite annual rate of population change (??t-??=0.969, 95{\%} CRI 0.957-0.980) and the resulting realized population change (proportion of the initial population present in 2012; ????2012=0.501, 95{\%} CRI 0.383-0.641). The estimated decline was considerably greater than the approximately 30{\%} decline estimated using conventional mark-recapture and occupancy approaches (Tempel and Guti??rrez, 2013). The IPM likely yielded a greater decline because it allowed for the inclusion of three years of data from the beginning of the study that were omitted from previous analyses to meet the assumptions of mark-recapture models. The IPM may also have yielded a greater estimate of decline than occupancy models owing to an increase in the number of territories occupied by single owls over the study period. All demographic parameters (adult and juvenile apparent survival, reproductive rate, immigration rate) were positively correlated with ??t??, but immigration was fairly high (immt??=0.097, 95{\%} CRI 0.055-0.140) and contributed most to temporal variation in ??t??, suggesting that changes in owl abundance were influenced by processes occurring outside of our study area. More broadly, our results indicated that the IPM framework has the potential to strengthen inference in population monitoring and demographic studies, particularly for those involving long-lived species whose abundance may be slowly declining. In our case, the conservation implications from the results of the IPM suggested a decline in the population of owls that was steeper than previously thought. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Context Predator dynamics may be related to prey abundance and influenced by environmental effects, such as climate. Predatorprey interactions may be represented by mechanistic models that comprise a deterministic skeleton with stochastic climatic forcing. Aims The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of climate on predatorprey dynamics. The lynx and snowshoe hare predatorprey system in the Kluane region of the Yukon, Canada, is used as a case study. The specific hypothesis is that climate influences the relationship between lynx and hare abundance. Methods We evaluate 10 linear relationships between predator and prey abundance and effects of climate. We use data on lynx and snowshoe hare abundance over 21 years in the Yukon as the predatorprey system, and three alternative broad-scale climate indices: the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the Pacific North American (PNA) index and the North Pacific index (NPI). Key results There was more support, as assessed by Akaike weights (i=0.600), evidence ratio (=4.73) and R 2 (=0.77) for a model of predator (lynx) and prior prey (hare) abundance with an effect of prior climate (winter NAO) when combined in a multiplicative, rather than in an additive, manner. The results infer that climate changes the amplitude of the lynx cycle with lower predator (lynx) abundance with positive values of winter NAO for a given hare density. Conclusions The study provides evidence that predatorprey dynamics are related to climate in an interactive manner. The ecological mechanism for the interactive effect is not clear, and alternative hypotheses are proposed for future evaluation. Implications The study implies that changes in climate may alter predatorprey relationships. {\textcopyright} 2011 CSIRO.},

Furthermore, prey refuges are neither necessary nor sufficient to explain all observed instances of local coexistence of predators and prey. We present a model in which intertidal boundaries of prey are set by equilibria between predation and prey production. Predation and prey productivity vary with environmental gradients and with explicit spatial configurations of the prey. This synthesis relies on insights of the original paradigm, incorporates the contradictory observations, and depends on novel capabilities afforded by spatially explicit computer simulations. The resulting synthesis provides explanations for distinctive aspects of zonation, including abrupt prey boundaries in continuous gradients of predation, and converging upper and lower prey boundaries in gradients of decreasing wave exposure.},

abstract = {In 2016, the New Zealand Government announced a policy to rid the country of key introduced predators (possums (Trichosurus vulpecula), ship rats (Rattus rattus), Norway rats (R. norvegicus) and mustelids (Mustela spp.)) by 2050. An interim goal under this policy is to remove all mammalian predators (the key species as well as mice (Mus musculus), kiore (R. exulans), cats (Felis catus), pigs (Sus scrofa) and hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus)) from island nature reserves by 2025. We identify the New Zealand islands over one hectare managed as reserves by the Department of Conservation (DOC) that have mammalian predators that can be eradicated. There are over 850 islands, islets, stacks and vegetated rocks in the New Zealand archipelago. We exclude islands in lakes and rivers and those smaller than one hectare, which leaves 616 islands, less than half of which are under some form of reserve status (286 islands entirely managed by DOC and 13 under mixed tenures but with some reserve land). One or more mammalian predators are known to occur on 48 of these islands, with the Government's 2050 target species on 42 islands and other predators (in the absence of the target species) on six islands. The Government's 2025 goal nominates one class of reserve, nature reserves. Of the 48 islands, just four islands are classed as nature reserves – two (Mauitaha and Araara Islands) with protected kiore in the Hen and Chickens group and two in the Auckland Islands group (Auckland with mice, cats and pigs; and Masked with mice and cats) – i.e. none with the key species of the wider 2050 goal. Therefore, we consider other reserve classes but place more or less strict risks of reinvasion, as indexed by known swimming ranges of the predators, to judge the feasibility of eradication. Relaxing the reserve class of the island, but not our selection of swimming ranges, results in 15 candidate islands where all mammalian predators present could be eradicated for the 2025 interim goal. Decisions on which islands to select for the programme need to consider costs and other constraints to eradicate different combinations of predators, and whether the island and its predators provide templates for the wider vision of a predator-free New Zealand, i.e. whether any of the key 2050 predators are present, the size of the island, and/or the presence of human inhabitants that complicate the predators to be targeted or constrain the use of some control methods.},

abstract = {Data augmentation (DA) is a flexible tool for analyzing closed and open population models of capture-recapture data, especially models which include sources of hetereogeneity among individuals. The essential concept underlying DA, as we use the term, is based on adding "observations'' to create a dataset composed of a known number of individuals. This new (augmented) dataset, which includes the unknown number of individuals N in the population, is then analyzed using a new model that includes a reformulation of the parameter N in the conventional model of the observed (unaugmented) data. In the context of capture-recapture models, we add a set of "all zero'' encounter histories which are not, in practice, observable. The model of the augmented dataset is a zero-inflated version of either a binomial or a multinomial base model. Thus, our use of DA provides a general approach for analyzing both closed and open population models of all types. In doing so, this approach provides a unified framework for the analysis of a huge range of models that are treated as unrelated "black boxes'' and named procedures in the classical literature. As a practical matter, analysis of the augmented dataset by MCMC is greatly simplified compared to other methods that require specialized algorithms. For example, complex capture-recapture models of an augmented dataset can be fitted with popular MCMC software packages (WinBUGS or JAGS) by providing a concise statement of the model's assumptions that usually involves only a few lines of pseudocode. In this paper, we review the basic technical concepts of data augmentation, and we provide examples of analyses of closed-population models (M-0, M-h, distance sampling, and spatial capture-recapture models) and open-population models (Jolly-Seber) with individual effects.},

abstract = {Hurlbert divides experimental ecologist into 'those who do not see any need for dispersion (of replicated treatments and controls), and those who do recognize its importance and take whatever measures are necessary to achieve a good dose of it'. Experimental ecologists could also be divided into those who do not see any problems with sacrificing spatial and temporal scales in order to obtain replication, and those who understand that appropriate scale must always have priority over replication. If an experiment is conducted in a spatial or temporal scale, where the predictions of contesting hypotheses are convergent or ambiguous, no amount of technical impeccability can make the work instructive. Conversely, replication can always be obtained afterwards, by conducting more experiments with basically similar design in different areas and by using meta-analysis. This approach even reduces the sampling bias obtained if resources are allocated to a small number of well-replicated experiments. For a strict advocate of the hypothetico-deductive method, replication is unnecessary even as a matter of principle, unless the predicted response is so weak that random background noise is a plausible excuse for a discrepancy between predictions and results. By definition, a prediction is an 'all- statement', referring to all systems within a well-defined category. What applies to all must apply to any. Hence, choosing two systems and assigning them randomly to a treatment and a control is normally an adequate design for a deductive experiment. The strength of such experiments depends on the firmness of the predictions and their a priori probability of corroboration. Replication is but one of many ways of reducing this probability. Whether the experiment is replicated or not, inferential statistics should always be used, to enable the reader to judge how well the apparent patterns in samples reflect real patterns in statistical populations. The concept 'pseudoreplication' amounts to entirely unwarranted stigmatization of a reasonable way to test predictions referring to large-scale systems.},

No common native bird species showed short-term negative effects post-1080. Three species – tomtit (Petroica macrocephala), silvereye (Zosterops lateralis), grey warbler (Gerygone igata) – increased significantly.

abstract = {There is growing recognition of the important roles played by predators in regulating ecosystems and sustaining biodiversity. Much attention has focused on the consequences of predator-regulation of herbivore populations, and associated trophic cascades. However apex predators may also control smaller ?mesopredators? through intraguild interactions. Removal of apex predators can result in changes to intraguild interactions and outbreaks of mesopredators (?mesopredator release?), leading in turn to increased predation on smaller prey. Here we provide a review and synthesis of studies of predator interactions, mesopredator release and their impacts on biodiversity. Mesopredator suppression by apex predators is widespread geographically and taxonomically. Apex predators suppress mesopredators both by killing them, or instilling fear, which motivates changes in behaviour and habitat use that limit mesopredator distribution and abundance. Changes in the abundance of apex predators may have disproportionate (up to fourfold) effects on mesopredator abundance. Outcomes of interactions between predators may however vary with resource availability, habitat complexity and the complexity of predator communities. There is potential for the restoration of apex predators to have benefits for biodiversity conservation through moderation of the impacts of mesopredators on their prey, but this requires a whole-ecosystem view to avoid unforeseen negative effects.},

abstract = {Rats contribute to the decline of tropical seabird populations by affecting their breeding success through direct predation of eggs and chicks. When they coexist with other predators, invasive rats may also generate indirect interactions via the changes they impose on the structure of communities and trophic interactions following invasion ('hyperpredation process'), or when apex predators are eradicated from the ecosystem ('mesopredator release effect'). Understanding these effects is necessary to implement restoration operations that actually benefit threatened seabird populations. We investigated these processes on two French tropical seabird islands of the western Indian Ocean, Europa and Juan de Nova, where black rats coexist with two different apex predator species (introduced cats and potentially native barn owls). The parallel use of several methods (diet analysis, stable isotopes, seabird monitoring) to identify trophic roles of rats revealed that the direct impact of rats on seabirds was particularly high on Europa where only rats and owls occur, with high consumption of chicks resulting in low breeding success for several seabird species. We also suggested that hyperpredation associated with top-down regulation of cats is occurring on Juan de Nova, although territoriality of cats may buffer this process. Conversely we found evidence that mesopredator release effect is unlikely, irrespective of the apex predator identity. Considering the most likely effects on both islands we provided recommendations on eradication priorities to mitigate the risk of local extinction that seabirds are currently facing.},

This synthesis relies on insights of the original paradigm, incorporates the contradictory observations, and depends on novel capabilities afforded by spatially explicit computer simulations. The resulting synthesis provides explanations for distinctive aspects of zonation, including abrupt prey boundaries in continuous gradients of predation, and converging upper and lower prey boundaries in gradients of decreasing wave exposure.},

A technique of weighting the proportion of countervailing feedback cycles in qualitative response predictions (weighted predictions) was tested against quantitative predictions from the inverse community matrix. Specifically, in nine each of 5- and 10- variable models (of varying complexity) we randomly assigned quantitative values of interaction strength and measured correspondence with qualitative predictions in terms of response strength and sign. Based on the techniques and analyses presented herein, we report an expanded scope of inference for qualitative models of any size and complexity and conclude that system structure is of overriding importance. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, the physiological mechanisms that mediate masting events and link them to weather and plant resources are still debated. Here, we explore how masting is affected by plant resource budgets, fruit maturation success, and hormonal coordination of cues including weather and resources. There is little empirical support for the commonly stated hypothesis that plants store carbohydrates over several years to expend in a high-seed year. Plants can switch carbohydrates away from growth in high-seed years, and seed crops are more probably limited by nitrogen or phosphorus. Resources are clearly involved in the proximate mechanisms driving masting, but resource budget (RB) models cannot create masting in the absence of selection because some underlying selective benefit is required to set the level of a ‘full' seed crop at greater than the annual resource increment. Economies of scale (EOSs) provide the ultimate factor selecting for masting, but EOSs probably always interact with resources, which modify the relationship between weather cues and reproduction. Thus, RB and EOS models are not alternative explanations for masting – both are required. Experiments manipulating processes that affect mast seeding will help clarify the physiological mechanisms that underlie mast seeding.},

abstract = {Predicting the dynamics and impacts of multiple invasive species can be complex because ecological relationships, which occur among several trophic levels, are often incompletely understood. Further, the complexity of these trophic relationships exacerbates our inability to predict climate change effects on invaded ecosystems. We explore the hypothesis that interactions between two global change drivers, invasive vertebrates and climate change, will potentially make matters worse for native biodiversity. In New Zealand beech (Nothofagus spp.) forests, a highly irruptive invasive mammal community is driven by multi-annual resource pulses of beech seed (masting). Because mast frequency is predicted to increase with climate change, we use this as a model system to explore the extent to which such effects may influence invasive vertebrate communities, and the implications of such interactions for native biodiversity and its management. We build on an established model of trophic interactions in the system, combining it with a logistic probability mast function, the parameters of which were altered to simulate either contemporary conditions or conditions of more or less frequent masting. The model predicts that increased mast frequency will lead to populations of a top predator (the stoat) and a mesopredator (the ship rat) becoming less irruptive and being maintained at appreciably higher average abundances in this forest type. In addition, the ability of both current and in-development management approaches to suppress invasive mammals is predicted to be compromised. Because invasive mammals are key drivers of native fauna extinction in New Zealand, with the additional loss of associated functions such as pollination and seed dispersal, these predictions imply potentially serious adverse impacts of climate change for the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem function. Our study also highlights the importance of long-term monitoring data for assessing and managing future impacts of global change drivers.},

abstract = {Fluctuating populations of small mammals provide an excellent opportunity to study the functional and numerical responses of predators because of the wide range in prey density that occurs. I reinterpret data from six studies that have examined the role of predation in the population dynamics of votes in California, southern Sweden and western Finland, of snowshoe hares in northern Canada, and of house mice and rabbits in Australia. Most studies have measured functional responses by relying on changes in diet as reflected by seat or stomach contents. These methods are probably biased toward showing predator satiation. Contrary to previous conclusions I find that there is little evidence for non-linear (Type III) functional-response curves or predator satiation at high prey densities. Recent studies indicate that the functional and numerical responses of predators can be rapid and strong enough to initiate cyclic declines, dampen fluctuations, or even cause stable numbers. The exception to this appears to be the irruptions of mice and rabbits in Australia. I propose a general explanation for the role of predation whereby the effect of predation is largely dependent on the entire prey community. When potentially cyclic prey are a small component of the overall prey biomass, generalist predators are able to prevent fluctuations by strong functional or numerical responses. As the prey community becomes dominated by a few species that fluctuate, limit cycles predominate. Limit cycles turn into irruptive population dynamics when seasonal prey reproduction is eliminated because of extended periods of vegetation growth (vegetation flushes following drought). In the future we must test assumptions underlying the way we study predation by telemetric monitoring of prey mortality and by experimentally manipulating predation.},

abstract = {Hierarchical modeling of abundance in space or time using closed-population mark-recapture under heterogeneity (model $\backslash$($\backslash$hbox {\{}M{\}}{\_}{\{}$\backslash$text {\{}h{\}}{\}}$\backslash$)) presents two challenges: (i) finding a flexible likelihood in which abundance appears as an explicit parameter and (ii) fitting the hierarchical model for abundance. The first challenge arises because abundance not only indexes the population size, it also determines the dimension of the capture probabilities in heterogeneity models. A common approach is to use data augmentation to include these capture probabilities directly into the likelihood and fit the model using Bayesian inference via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Two such examples of this approach are (i) explicit trans-dimensional MCMC, and (ii) superpopulation data augmentation. The superpopulation approach has the advantage of simple specification that is easily implemented in BUGS and related software. However, it reparameterizes the model so that abundance is no longer included, except as a derived quantity. This is a drawback when hierarchical models for abundance, or related parameters, are desired. Here, we analytically compare the two approaches and show that they are more closely related than might appear superficially. We exploit this relationship to specify the model in a way that allows us to include abundance as a parameter and that facilitates hierarchical modeling using readily available software such as BUGS. We use this approach to model trends in grizzly bear abundance in Yellowstone National Park from 1986 to 1998.},

abstract = {Implementing ecosystem-based fisheries management requires indicators and models that address the impacts of fishing across entire ecological communities. However, the complexity of many ecosystems presents a challenge to analysis, especially if reliant on quantification because of the onerous task of precisely measuring or estimating numerous parameters. We present qualitative modelling as a complementary approach to quantitative methods. Qualitative modelling clarifies how community structure alone affects dynamics, here of exploited populations. We build an array of models that describe different ecosystems with different harvesting practices, and analyse them to predict responses to various perturbations. This approach demonstrates the utility of qualitative modelling as a means to identify and interpret community-level indicators for systems that are at or near equilibrium, and for those that are frequently perturbed away from equilibrium. Examining the interaction of ecological and socio-economic variables associated with commercial fisheries provides an understanding of the main feedbacks that drive and regulate exploited ecosystems. The method is particularly useful for systems where the basic relationships between variables are understood but where precise or detailed data are lacking.},

abstract = {Holdaway (1989) described three phases of historical extinctions and declines in New Zealand avifauna, the last of which (Group III, declining 1780–1986) was associated with European hunting, habitat clearance, and predation and competition from introduced European mammals. Some forest bird species have continued to decline since 1986, while others have increased, usually after intensive species-specific research and management programmes. In this paper, we review what is known about major causes of current declines or population limitation, including predation, competition for food or another resource, disease, forest loss, and genetic problems such as inbreeding depression and reduced genetic variation. Much experimental and circumstantial evidence suggests or demonstrates that predation by introduced mammals remains the primary cause of declines and limitation in remaining large native forest tracts. Predation alone is generally sufficient to explain the observed declines, but complex interactions between factors that vary between species and sites are likely to be the norm and are difficult to study. Currently, the rather limited evidence for food shortage is mostly circumstantial and may be obscured by interactions with predation. Climate and food supply determine the number of breeding attempts made by herbivorous species, but predation by introduced mammals ultimately determines the outcome of those attempts. After removal of pest mammals, populations are apparently limited by other factors, including habitat area, food supply, disease or avian predators. Management of these, and of inbreeding depression in bottlenecked populations, is likely to assist the effectiveness and resilience of management programmes. At the local or regional scale, however, forest area itself may be limiting in deforested parts of New Zealand. Without predator management, the number of native forest birds on the New Zealand mainland is predicted to continue to decline.},

abstract = {Sugar-rich honeydew production by phloem-feeding sooty beech scale insects (Ultracoelostoma spp.) is a keystone ecological process in New Zealand beech (Nothofagus) forest. A dynamical model to describe the formation of individual honeydew droplets is derived using simple fluid dynamics. The model assumes that the insects play little part in regulating flow, and that flow is driven by phloem hydrostatic pressure and regulated by environmental conditions affecting water evaporation from droplets. The model predicts different types of behaviour depending on local environmental conditions. In dry conditions, evaporation rates are high and honeydew droplets can become so concentrated that further excretion is prevented and droplet formation ceases. In humid conditions, the high concentrations required to prevent droplet formation do not occur and droplets continue to grow indefinitely. The model is fitted to new data and the data are used to estimate values for the rate of flow of phloem sap through the insect and for the concentration required to prevent further excretion. Model predictions provide a close qualitative match to field data. However, rates of fluid flow from the trees through the insects would need to be much greater than the model assumes to produce values for droplet production that match field data. This suggests that the insects are playing an active role in regulating the flow rate. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Islands are important for the conservation of biodiversity because they house 20{\%} of terrestrial plant and vertebrate species, have suffered 64{\%} of IUCN-listed extinctions and have 45{\%} of IUCN-listed critically endangered species. Yet islands make up only about five percent of the earths surface. The main cause of extinction and endangerment to biodiversity on islands is the presence of invasive vertebrates. Fortunately, many future extinctions can be prevented by eradicating invasive vertebrates from islands. To assess the current state of this conservation tool, we are compiling a global database of terrestrial vertebrate eradications from islands, including successes and failures. To date, in the Global Islands Invasives Vertebrate Eradication Database we have documented approximately 950 island eradication attempts involving 28 species of invasive vertebrates in 12 families. These are preliminary data and will be updated and checked for accuracy as part of the Island Invasives: Eradication and Management conference, Auckland 2010. Most eradication attempts have been of rodents ({\textgreater}350) and bovid ungulates ({\textgreater}160). Moderate numbers of eradication attempts have been of cats ({\textgreater}90), suid ungulates ({\textgreater}55), and rabbits ({\textgreater}45). Most projects have been on islands smaller than 500 ha (68{\%}) and in temperate climates (72{\%}). Targeting eradications on larger and more tropical islands would lead to the protection of more biodiversity. To this end, our vision is to maintain an accurate, web-accessible, regularly updated database that can be used to promote and improve the protection of island ecosystems by eradicating invasive vertebrates.},

abstract = {The mohua or yellowhead (Mohoua ochrocephala) is an endangered, hole-nesting forest bird endemic to New Zealand. Mohua suffer periodic population crashes due to severe predation by the introduced stoat (Mustela erminea). In 1990, a stoat population irruption provided an opportunity to reassess the impact of stoat predation on mohua and to test two linked hypotheses: that adaquate control of stoats by trapping is possible, and that it is a viable management option to assist mohua recovery. The primary experiment (summer 1990/91) was repeated in the summers of 1991/92 and 1992/93 when stoat numbers were lower. Mohua productivity and adult female mortality were compared in two study areas, one trapped and one untrapped, in the Eglinton Valley, Fiordland. Sixty-two stoats were caught in the 50 ha trapped area during summer 1990/91. The fledging of many first clutches, and the laying of second clutches, coincided closely with the period when high numbers of stoats were being caught in traps. Eighty percent of the nests in the trapped area fledged young, compared with only 36{\%} in the untrapped area. Pairs produced nearly twice as many young in the trapped area. A higher proportion of breeding females disappeared from the untrapped area. In the two subsequent summers, 29 and 14 stoats were caught, and breeding success was higher than previously recorded in both trapped and untrapped areas. We suggest that trapping in the year following a stoat irruption may also be warranted.},

abstract = {Top-predators have been reported to have an important role in structuring food webs and maintaining ecological processes for the benefit of biodiversity at lower trophic levels. This is thought to be achieved through their suppressive effects on sympatric mesopredators and prey. Great scientific and public interest surrounds the potential use of top-predators as biodiversity conservation tools, and it can often be difficult to separate what we think we know and what we really know about their ecological utility. Not all the claims made about the ecological roles of top-predators can be substantiated by current evidence. We review the methodology underpinning empirical data on the ecological roles of Australian dingoes (Canis lupus dingo and hybrids) to provide a comprehensive and objective benchmark for knowledge of the ecological roles of Australia's largest terrestrial predator. From a wide variety of methodological flaws, sampling bias, and experimental design constraints inherent to 38 of the 40 field studies we assessed, we demonstrate that there is presently unreliable and inconclusive evidence for dingoes' role as a biodiversity regulator. We also discuss the widespread (both taxonomically and geographically) and direct negative effects of dingoes to native fauna, and the few robust studies investigating their positive roles. In light of the highly variable and context-specific impacts of dingoes on faunal biodiversity and the inconclusive state of the literature, we strongly caution against the positive management of dingoes in the absence of a supporting evidence-base for such action. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Introduced stoats (Mustela erminea) are important invasive predators in southern beech (Nothofagus sp.) forests in New Zealand. In these forests, one of their primary prey species - introduced house mice (Mus musculus), fluctuate dramatically between years, driven by the irregular heavy seed-fall (masting) of the beech trees. We examined the effects of mice on stoats in this system by comparing the weights, age structure and population densities of stoats caught on two large islands in Fiordland, New Zealand - one that has mice (Resolution Island) and one that does not (Secretary Island). On Resolution Island, the stoat population showed a history of recruitment spikes and troughs linked to beech masting, whereas the Secretary Island population had more constant recruitment, indicating that rodents are probably the primary cause for the boom and bust' population cycle of stoats in beech forests. Resolutions Island stoats were 10{\%} heavier on average than Secretary Island stoats, supporting the hypothesis that the availability of larger prey (mice verses wet) leads to larger stoats. Beech masting years on this island were also correlated with a higher weight for stoats born in the year of the masting event. The detailed demographic information on the stoat populations of these two islands supports previously suggested interactions among mice, stoats and beech masting. These interactions may have important consequences for the endemic species that interact with fluctuating populations of mice and stoats.},

The extent to which structure and function of islands where rats have been eradicated will converge on uninvaded islands remains unclear. We compared three groups of islands in New Zealand: islands never invaded by rats, islands with rats, and islands on which rats have been controlled. Differences between island groups in soil and leaf chemistry and leaf production were largely explained by burrow densities. Community structure of woody seedlings differed by rat history and burrow density. Plots on islands with high seabird densities had themost non-native plant species. Sincemost impacts of rats were mediated through seabird density, the removal of rats without seabird recolonization is unlikely to result in a reversal of these processes. Even if seabirds return, a novel plant community may emerge.},

In addition, the distribution of native predators may influence species num- ber. There is statistical evidence that coyotes control the pop- ulations of smaller predators such as foxes and domestic cats. The absence of coyotes may lead to higher levels of predation by a process of mesopredator release. The distance of canyons from other patches of chaparral habitat does not add significantly to the explained variance in chaparral- requiring species number-probably because of the virtual inability of most chaparral-requiring species to disperse through developed areas and nonscrub habitats. These re- sults and other lines of evidence suggest that chaparral- requiring birds in isolated canyons have very high rates of extinction, in part because of their low vagility. The best predictors of vulnerability of the individual species are their abundances (densities) in undisturbed habitat and their body sizes; together these two variables account for 95 per- cent of the variation in canyon occupancy. A hypothesis is proposed to account for the similarity between the steep slopes of species-area curves for chaparral-requiring birds and the slopes for some forest birds on small islands or in habitat fragments. The provision of corridors appears to be the most effective design and planning featuref or preventing the elimination of chaparral-requiring species in a fragmented landscape.},

abstract = {In this review we summarised published knowledge about small mammal population recovery in re-gard to sudden population collapse of small mammal species regardless if it is caused by natural or man-made events. We determined recovery mechanisms, recovery time and recovery rate to make suggestions how to adapt and optimise current {\^{A}}¬methods for the regulation of small mammal population size for pest management and for conservation. It is vital to know the principles of recovery mechanisms for pest control and conservation to align management methods either to sustainably keep animal abundance at a permanent minimum level or to increase population size. Collapses can be caused naturally as in the decline phase of multi-annual fluctuations and after natu-ral disasters or by man-made events such as pesticide applications. In general, there are two ways for recovery to take place: in situ survival and multiplication of a small remaining fraction of the population, immigration, or a combination thereof. The recovery mechanism strongly depends on life-history strategy, social behaviour and density-dependent processes in population dynamics of the species in question. Also, the kind of disturbance, its intensity and spatial scale as well as environmental circumstances such as the presence and distance of refuge areas have to be taken into account. Recovery time can vary from a couple of days to several years, depending on the species{\^{a}} reproductive potential, and the kind of disturbances no matter whether collapse is man-made or naturally. Ultimately, most populations rebound to levels equal to pre-collapse numbers. Based on present knowledge, case-by-case decisions seem appropriate for small scale conservation action. For pest control operation a large scale approach seems necessary. Further research activities are required to make sound species specific recommendations.},

abstract = {The genus Nothofagus in New Zealand and Australia exhibits strong mast seeding (i.e. highly variable seed crops between years). Seed crop variation is synchronized within and between species over large spatial scales, and results in greatly increased wind pollination efficiency which could provide a selective benefit favouring the maintenance of mast seeding. However, the null hypothesis (that plants simply match their reproductive effort to the variable resources available each year) has not been tested in Nothofagus. Here we use a 33-year dataset on seedfall and wood ring increments for 19 individual Nothofagus truncata trees at Orongorongo, New Zealand, to test for the presence of switching (exaggeration of seedfall variability by diverting resources into, then out of, reproduction). A generalized least squares model explained 40.7{\%} of the variance in standardized ring widths, using six weather variables (absolute minimum temperatures in March (lag 0) April (lag 0 and lag 1), May (lag 0) and rainfall in November and February (lag 0) ) and seedfall. Seedfall had a negative relationship with the current year's ring widths even after controlling for all significant weather variables. This shows that switching is occurring in N. truncata within individuals among years, and therefore that masting in this species is the result of selective forces such as increased wind pollination efficiency. As this result has been demonstrated for very few masting species, we call for this test to be applied more widely.},

abstract = {Three male and two female ship rats (Rattus rattus) were radio-tagged and tracked in beech (Nothofagus) forest in the Eglinton Valley, Fiordland, New Zealand over two field periods in 1996 and 2000. The home range of each animal was calculated using the minimum convex polygon method. Ranges of three male rats were 7.5, 9.1, and 11.4 ha whereas those of the female rats were 0.89 and 0.27 ha. The home ranges recorded for male rats were considerably larger than those reported from other studies in non-beech forest. Ship rats are important predators of forest birds, and home range information could be used to provide a guide for trap or bait station spacing in beech forests. To carry out rat control in beech forests effectively, further studies are needed to determine if the results of this pilot study are typical, and if home ranges of ship rats change with season, or at various stages of the beech mast cycle.},

We used Bayesian state space models to estimate the observation and process error in time-series of 55 globally distributed populations of two species, Cervus elaphus (elk/red deer) and Rangifer tarandus (caribou/reindeer). We examined variation among populations and species in the magnitude of estimates of error components and density dependence using generalized linear models. Process error exceeded observation error in 75{\%} of all populations, and on average, both components of error were greater in Rangifer than in Cervus populations. Observation error differed significantly across the different observation methods, and predation and time-series length differentially affected the error components. Comparing the Bayesian model results to traditional models that do not separate error components revealed the potential for misleading inferences about sources of variation in population dynamics.},

abstract = {1Owing to the detrimental impacts of invasive alien species, their control is often a priority for conservation management. Whereas the potential for unforeseen consequences of management is recognized, their associated complexity and costs are less widely appreciated.2We demonstrate that theoretically plausible trophic cascades associated with invasive species removal not only take place in reality, but can also result in rapid and drastic landscape-wide changes to ecosystems.3Using a combination of population data from of an invasive herbivore, plot-scale vegetation analyses, and satellite imagery, we show how a management intervention to eradicate a mesopredator has inadvertently and rapidly precipitated landscape-wide change on sub-Antarctic Macquarie Island. This happened despite the eradication being positioned within an integrated pest management framework. Following eradication of cats Felis catus in 2001, rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus numbers increased substantially although a control action was in place (Myxoma virus), resulting in island-wide ecosystem effects.4Synthesis and applications. Our results highlight an important lesson for conservation agencies working to eradicate invasive species globally; that is, risk assessment of management interventions must explicitly consider and plan for their indirect effects, or face substantial subsequent costs. On Macquarie Island, the cost of further conservation action will exceed AU{\$}24 million.},

abstract = {In the Holarctic, predation by mustelids on birds is often linked to population cycles of rodents (especially voles and lemmings) because birds may be buffered against mustelid predation at high rodent densities. By contrast, interguild relationships between introduced mustelids and rodents can have very different consequences for native birds in ecosystems where mustelids have been introduced. Here, we consider the interactions between Stoats Mustela erminea, feral House Mice Mus musculus and native birds in New Zealand beech Nothofagus spp. forests. We conclude that buffering to protect birds from Stoat predation normally fails in these systems, because peak populations of mice in these forests are low by Holarctic standards, and mice usually do not become sufficiently abundant to distract increased numbers of Stoats from preying on birds. However, temporary buffering is possible during rare episodes of extreme mouse abundance.},

We review current knowledge of invasive predator ecology and control technologies in New Zealand and the biological research, technological advances, social capacity and enabling policy required. We discuss the economic costs and benefits and conclude with a 50-year strategy for a predator-free New Zealand that is shown to be ecologically obtainable, socially desirable, and economically viable. The proposal includes invasive predator eradication from the two largest offshore islands, mammal-free mainland peninsulas, very large ecosanctuaries, plus thousands of small projects that will together merge eradication and control concepts on landscape scales.},

abstract = {Fluctuating populations of small mammals provide an excellent opportunity to study the functional and numerical responses of predators because of the wide range in prey density that occurs. I reinterpret data from six studies that have examined the role of predation in the population dynamics of voles in California, southern Sweden and western Finland, of snowshoe hares in northern Canada, and of house mice and rabbits in Australia. Most studies have measured functional responses by relying on changes in diet as reflected by scat or stomach contents. These methods are probably biased toward showing predator satiation. Contrary to previous conclusions I find that there is little evidence for non-linear (Type 111) functional-response curves or predator satiation at high prey densities. Recent studies indicate that the functional and numerical responses of predators can be rapid and strong enough to initiate cyclic declines, dampen fluctuations, or even cause stable numbers. The exception to this appears to be the irruptions of mice and rabbits in Australia. I propose a general explanation for the role of predation whereby the effect of predation is largely dependent on the entire prey community. When potentially cyclic prey are a small component of the overall prey biomass, generalist predators are able to prevent fluctuations by strong functional or numerical responses. As the prey community becomes dominated by a few species that fluctuate, limit cycles predominate. Limit cycles turn into irruptive population dynamics when seasonal prey reproduction is eliminated because of extended periods of vegetation growth (vegetation flushes following drought). In the future we must test assumptions underlying the way we study predation by telemetric monitoring of prey mortality and by experimentally manipulating predation.},

abstract = {The widespread invasive rodents Rattus norvegicus, R. rattus, R. exulans and Mus musculus have been implicated in the decline and extinction of hundreds of island endemic vertebrates, but their effects on island invertebrates are less well-known. Here I present the first global review of the subject, which confirms that large-bodied invertebrates are most at risk from these rodents, and that although a disproportionate number of studies (69{\%}) are from New Zealand, rodent-invertebrate impacts are geographically widespread. Mechanisms of impact are both direct (mediated by predation) and indirect (involving intermediary species). Some studies also suggest knock-on effects on ecosystem properties, and given the diverse ecological functions of invertebrates (as detritivores, primary consumers, predators, prey and pollinators), I suggest that an understanding of the interactions between invasive rodents and invertebrates in island ecosystems is essential for effective conservation management. Currently many reported impacts are unquantified, come from uncontrolled and unreplicated designs, or rely on time-series with inadequate baseline data. In addition to basic improvements in study design, this review highlights a need for studies which investigate mechanisms of impact, or impacts across trophic levels. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A paradigm is a set of mutually supportive hypotheses that provides a frame of reference within a field. In 1962, Kuhn proposed that paradigms form within the dual contexts of empirical evidence and intellectual history. Facts potentially contradictory to a paradigm may not be recognized until they are observed repeatedly and incorporated as supportive evidence into a new theory. Support for this interpretation can be found in the history of a paradigm of predation in rocky intertidal communities. Hypotheses were developed in the contexts of innovative field experiments and historical arguments of competition theory. The resulting paradigm proposed that predators restrict populations of competitively dominant prey to refuges. Different types of refuge, or no refuge, prevail in different areas of the intertidal zone, accounting for patterns of prey distribution, the coexistence of natural enemies, and the local maintenance of diversity. An ensuing period of criticism made reference to potential contradictions. Rather than by predation alone, prey abundances are determined largely by an interplay of varying rates of predation and prey production. Furthermore, prey refuges are neither necessary nor sufficient to explain all observed instances of local coexistence of predators and prey. We present a model in which intertidal boundaries of prey are set by equilibria between predation and prey production. Predation and prey productivity vary with environmental gradients and with explicit spatial configurations of the prey. This synthesis relies on insights of the original paradigm, incorporates the contradictory observations, and depends on novel capabilities afforded by spatially explicit computer simulations. The resulting synthesis provides explanations for distinctive aspects of zonation, including abrupt prey boundaries in continuous gradients of predation, and converging upper and lower prey boundaries in gradients of decreasing wave exposure.},

abstract = {Context: Management of suites of invasive mammal species can lead to perverse outcomes, such as meso-predator release, or can achieve desirable reductions in the abundance of top-order predators by controlling their prey. Predictive models for predator–prey systems require estimates of predator functional responses, i.e. predation rates as functions of prey density. Aims: In New Zealand, estimates of the functional responses of stoats (Mustela erminea) to mice (Mus musculus) and ship (black) rats (Rattus rattus) are required to improve management models for these invasive species. Methods: We derived fitted relationships between the presence or absence of mouse or ship-rat remains in stoat guts and corresponding indices of prey abundance in beech and podocarp forests, respectively. To convert field data on stoat-gut contents to minimum kill rates, we used data on feeding activity and estimates of gut-passage time, observed in captive stoats. Key results: The most parsimonious fitted curves were Type II functional responses, with a steeper stoat–mouse curve for autumn–winter, indicating a more specialist feeding habit than that in spring–summer. Estimated kill rates of mice per stoat per day reached an asymptote of 1.13 during autumn–winter. Our maximum observed kill rate for spring–summer was 11{\%} less than the extrapolated upper limit of 1.04 mice per stoat per day for New Zealand ecosystems. No asymptote was reached within the limits of the data for the stoat–rat relationship. Conclusions: Recent models for trophic interactions between stoats and the primary rodent prey have overestimated kill rates by stoats in forested ecosystems, particularly at very low and very high densities of mice. We show how data on stoat-gut contents can be rescaled to estimate minimum kill rates of rodent prey. Implications: The functional-response relationships we have derived can be used to improve modelled predictions of the effects of natural or management-driven perturbations of invasive stoats and their primary rodent-prey populations.},

abstract = {Beech (Nothofagus) accounts for a large proportion of the privately owned indigenous forest in New Zealand that is available for timber production. In order to develop management plans for those beech forests there is a need to refine our knowledge on tree growth rates and to take account of tree size, local competition and regional differences. In this article, we use a large dataset on tree growth in unmanaged forests throughout New Zealand to develop size-specific growth models for the four beech species. In particular, we model both normal ("average") and above-average ("rapid") diameter growth rates. We found that average tree diameter growth rates were typically between 1 and 3 mm/yr and rapid tree diameter growth rates ranged between 1 and 5 mm/yr. For stems under 500 mm diameter at breast height, hard and red beech typically grew faster than black-mountain and silver beech. However, for larger trees, the fastest rates were found in black-mountain beech in Southland and silver beech in Nelson-Marlborough. Growth rates of ≤ 10 mm/yr were extremely rare in our dataset and accounted for {\textless}0.2{\%} of all trees (27 out of 17,781 trees). Data from thinning trials show that beech trees can achieve growth rates in excess of 6 mm/yr, making a compelling case for further stand thinning to enhance the generally slow growth rates of beech in unmanaged forests.},

abstract = {We compare qualitative predictions of press perturbation response from community matrix models with those of a range of numerical simulations on the same models. A technique of weighting the proportion of countervailing feedback cycles in qualitative response predictions (weighted predictions) was tested against quantitative predictions from the inverse community matrix. Specifically, in nine each of 5- and 10- variable models (of varying complexity) we randomly assigned quantitative values of interaction strength and measured correspondence with qualitative predictions in terms of response strength and sign. Based on the techniques and analyses presented herein, we report an expanded scope of inference for qualitative models of any size and complexity and conclude that system structure is of overriding importance. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Predicting the dynamics and impacts of multiple invasive species can be complex because ecological relationships, which occur among several trophic levels, are often incompletely understood. Further, the complexity of these trophic relationships exacerbates our inability to predict climate change effects on invaded ecosystems. We explore the hypothesis that interactions between two global change drivers, invasive vertebrates and climate change, will potentially make matters worse for native biodiversity. In New Zealand beech (Nothofagus spp.) forests, a highly irruptive invasive mammal community is driven by multi-annual resource pulses of beech seed (masting). Because mast frequency is predicted to increase with climate change, we use this as a model system to explore the extent to which such effects may influence invasive vertebrate communities, and the implications of such interactions for native biodiversity and its management. We build on an established model of trophic interactions in the system, combining it with a logistic probability mast function, the parameters of which were altered to simulate either contemporary conditions or conditions of more or less frequent masting. The model predicts that increased mast frequency will lead to populations of a top predator (the stoat) and a mesopredator (the ship rat) becoming less irruptive and being maintained at appreciably higher average abundances in this forest type. In addition, the ability of both current and in-development management approaches to suppress invasive mammals is predicted to be compromised. Because invasive mammals are key drivers of native fauna extinction in New Zealand, with the additional loss of associated functions such as pollination and seed dispersal, these predictions imply potentially serious adverse impacts of climate change for the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem function. Our study also highlights the importance of long-term monitoring data for assessing and managing future impacts of global change drivers.},

abstract = {We present two statistical models documenting variations in density indices of stoats and of mice in New Zealand southern beech (Nothofagus spp.) forests. They confirm previous, simpler correlations showing that the summer capture rate of stoats increases with spring mouse density index up to about 20-25 mouse captures per 100 trap-nights (C/100TN). However, at much higher mouse densities (60-80C/100TN), observed in the Grebe and Borland Valleys in southern Fiordland in 1979/80 and again in 1999/2000, fewer stoats were caught than expected. These models quantify a serious decline in capture rate of stoats during periods of high mouse abundance over the range 25-80C/100TN. At such times, management strategies aiming to protect threatened birds by intensive lethal trapping of stoats during the nesting seasons may be least effective just when they are most needed.},

abstract = {A computer model of the population dynamics of introduced house mice (Mus musculus L.), ship rats (Rattus rattus L.) and stoats (Mustela erminea L.) in New Zealand forest was constructed, to test the relative importance of food availability and predation in shaping observed small-mammal population dynamics. Ship rats and mice are the two common rodent species present in most New Zealand forests, and exhibit eruptive population dynamics. Stoats are the only common mammalian predator, and undergo large density fluctuations following periodic rodent eruptions. A number of outputs and predictions from the model were developed. The model highlights the overall importance of variation in food availability in determining the timing and amplitude of rodent population eruptions. It indicates that predators can not prevent a prey-species eruption, primarily due to differences in reproductive biology. Predation however, can delay the start of the prey-population increase during the eruption. The role of predators in limiting the peak prey-population size will depend on the size of the energy input. In a full-scale eruption following maximal tree seeding, predators cannot significantly truncate peak prey-population size. Predators should be able to significantly hasten the rate of decline in the prey populations, although the strength of predator limitation will depend on the severity of food limitation and cold-induced mortality over the same period. Predators can limit prey populations during the post-crash low phase. As with the crash phase, the strength of predator limitation in the low phase will depend on the severity of food limitation and natural mortality. The model highlights gaps in current knowledge of predator and prey species biology and ecology. The model highlights key areas where further field study should provide a better understanding of the factors driving small-mammal communities in New Zealand. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Invasive species are frequently the target of eradication or control programmes to mitigate their impacts. However, manipulating single species in isolation can lead to unexpected consequences for other species, with outcomes such as mesopredator release demonstrated both theoretically and empirically in vertebrate assemblages with at least two trophic levels. Less is known about the consequences of species removal in more complex assemblages where a greater number of interacting invaders increases the potential for selective species removal to result in unexpected changes in community structure. Using a replicated Before-After Control-Impact field experiment with a four-species assemblage of invasive mammals we show that species interactions in the community are dominated by competition rather than predation. There was no measurable response of two mesopredators (rats and mice) following control of the top predator (stoats), but there was competitive release of rats following removal of a herbivore (possums), and competitive release of mice following removal of rats},

abstract = {Repeatability (more precisely the common measure of repeatability, the intra-class correlation coefficient, ICC) is an important index for quantifying the accuracy of measurements and the constancy of phenotypes. It is the proportion of phenotypic variation that can be attributed to between-subject (or between-group) variation. As a consequence, the non-repeatable fraction of phenotypic variation is the sum of measurement error and phenotypic flexibility. There are several ways to estimate repeatability for Gaussian data, but there are no formal agreements on how repeatability should be calculated for non-Gaussian data (e.g. binary, proportion and count data). In addition to point estimates, appropriate uncertainty estimates (standard errors and confidence intervals) and statistical significance for repeatability estimates are required regardless of the types of data. We review the methods for calculating repeatability and the associated statistics for Gaussian and non-Gaussian data. For Gaussian data, we present three common approaches for estimating repeatability: correlation-based, analysis of variance (ANOVA)-based and linear mixed-effects model (LMM)-based methods, while for non-Gaussian data, we focus on generalised linear mixed-effects models (GLMM) that allow the estimation of repeatability on the original and on the underlying latent scale. We also address a number of methods for calculating standard errors, confidence intervals and statistical significance; the most accurate and recommended methods are parametric bootstrapping, randomisation tests and Bayesian approaches. We advocate the use of LMM- and GLMM-based approaches mainly because of the ease with which confounding variables can be controlled for. Furthermore, we compare two types of repeatability (ordinary repeatability and extrapolated repeatability) in relation to narrow-sense heritability. This review serves as a collection of guidelines and recommendations for biologists to calculate repeatability and heritability from both Gaussian and non-Gaussian data.},

Mohua populations in which most pairs attempted to raise two broods of chicks each year were more vulnerable to episodic stoat (Mustela erminea) predation than were populations in which pairs attempted to raise only one brood. However, those populations in which most pairs raised two broods had a much better ability to recover following predation. High stoat numbers every year would lead to the extinction of mohua populations regardless of their size and breeding strategy, but one-brood populations would decline more slowly. If stoat populations were high only once every 5 years (the likely natural rate in South Island beech forests), small populations, and populations in which most pairs raised only one brood a year, would have very low survival prospects, but two-brood populations of more than about 40 pairs would have good survival prospects. Reduction in stoat densities, particularly in years when their numbers are high, is likely to have a substantial positive effect on mohua populations.},

abstract = {The population dynamics of ship rats (Rattus rattus L.) were studied in podocarp/hardwood and hard beech (Nothofagus truncata) forest in the Orongorongo Valley, near Wellington, from 1971 to 1998. Rat density (indexed by captures in 116 snap traps over 3 nights per quarter) varied up to five-fold between consecutive years. Fruiting of hinau (Elaeocarpus dentatus) and hard beech did not drive the fluctuations as had been suggested. Average density increased over the first 15 years of the study (from 2.3 {\^{A}}± 0.3 to 7.5 {\^{A}}± 0.8 per 100 trap-nights (mean {\^{A}}± SE)), and then declined; this mirrored a trend in cat density driven by external factors. Breeding was largely restricted to spring (November) and summer (February). Breeding rate (proportion pregnant or lactating) was density-dependent, particularly in older rats. Litter size (based on live embryos and new uterine scars) increased between spring (4.4 {\^{A}}± 0.4) and summer (5.5 {\^{A}}± 0.3) (mean {\^{A}}± SE), but did not vary with density or age. Winter breeding was rare (2{\%} pregnant or lactating in August). Hinau fruitfall did not predict the proportion breeding in autumn (May), or survival in winter-spring (i.e., population change between August and November). Varying predation intensity was the most likely explanation for the population trend.

abstract = {In 2016, the New Zealand Government announced a policy to rid the country of key introduced predators (possums (Trichosurus vulpecula), ship rats (Rattus rattus), Norway rats (R. norvegicus) and mustelids (Mustela spp.)) by 2050. An interim goal under this policy is to remove all mammalian predators (the key species as well as mice (Mus musculus), kiore (R. exulans), cats (Felis catus), pigs (Sus scrofa) and hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus)) from island nature reserves by 2025. We identify the New Zealand islands over one hectare managed as reserves by the Department of Conservation (DOC) that have mammalian predators that can be eradicated. There are over 850 islands, islets, stacks and vegetated rocks in the New Zealand archipelago. We exclude islands in lakes and rivers and those smaller than one hectare, which leaves 616 islands, less than half of which are under some form of reserve status (286 islands entirely managed by DOC and 13 under mixed tenures but with some reserve land). One or more mammalian predators are known to occur on 48 of these islands, with the Government's 2050 target species on 42 islands and other predators (in the absence of the target species) on six islands. The Government's 2025 goal nominates one class of reserve, nature reserves. Of the 48 islands, just four islands are classed as nature reserves – two (Mauitaha and Araara Islands) with protected kiore in the Hen and Chickens group and two in the Auckland Islands group (Auckland with mice, cats and pigs; and Masked with mice and cats) – i.e. none with the key species of the wider 2050 goal. Therefore, we consider other reserve classes but place more or less strict risks of reinvasion, as indexed by known swimming ranges of the predators, to judge the feasibility of eradication. Relaxing the reserve class of the island, but not our selection of swimming ranges, results in 15 candidate islands where all mammalian predators present could be eradicated for the 2025 interim goal. Decisions on which islands to select for the programme need to consider costs and other constraints to eradicate different combinations of predators, and whether the island and its predators provide templates for the wider vision of a predator-free New Zealand, i.e. whether any of the key 2050 predators are present, the size of the island, and/or the presence of human inhabitants that complicate the predators to be targeted or constrain the use of some control methods.},

abstract = {Population viability analysis was used to assess the survival prospects of mohua (Mohoua ochrocephala) populations of varying sizes, with different breeding strategies and suffering predation episodes at varying frequencies, from the South Island of New Zealand. Mohua populations in which most pairs attempted to raise two broods of chicks each year were more vulnerable to episodic stoat (Mustela erminea) predation than were populations in which pairs attempted to raise only one brood. However, those populations in which most pairs raised two broods had a much better ability to recover following predation. High stoat numbers every year would lead to the extinction of mohua populations regardless of their size and breeding strategy, but one-brood populations would decline more slowly. If stoat populations were high only once every 5 years (the likely natural rate in South Island beech forests), small populations, and populations in which most pairs raised only one brood a year, would have very low survival prospects, but two-brood populations of more than about 40 pairs would have good survival prospects. Reduction in stoat densities, particularly in years when their numbers are high, is likely to have a substantial positive effect on mohua populations.},

abstract = {Hurlbert divides experimental ecologist into 'those who do not see any need for dispersion (of replicated treatments and controls), and those who do recognize its importance and take whatever measures are necessary to achieve a good dose of it'. Experimental ecologists could also be divided into those who do not see any problems with sacrificing spatial and temporal scales in order to obtain replication, and those who understand that appropriate scale must always have priority over replication. If an experiment is conducted in a spatial or temporal scale, where the predictions of contesting hypotheses are convergent or ambiguous, no amount of technical impeccability can make the work instructive. Conversely, replication can always be obtained afterwards, by conducting more experiments with basically similar design in different areas and by using meta-analysis. This approach even reduces the sampling bias obtained if resources are allocated to a small number of well-replicated experiments. For a strict advocate of the hypothetico-deductive method, replication is unnecessary even as a matter of principle, unless the predicted response is so weak that random background noise is a plausible excuse for a discrepancy between predictions and results. By definition, a prediction is an 'all- statement', referring to all systems within a well-defined category. What applies to all must apply to any. Hence, choosing two systems and assigning them randomly to a treatment and a control is normally an adequate design for a deductive experiment. The strength of such experiments depends on the firmness of the predictions and their a priori probability of corroboration. Replication is but one of many ways of reducing this probability. Whether the experiment is replicated or not, inferential statistics should always be used, to enable the reader to judge how well the apparent patterns in samples reflect real patterns in statistical populations. The concept 'pseudoreplication' amounts to entirely unwarranted stigmatization of a reasonable way to test predictions referring to large-scale systems.},

abstract = {Ecologists that study the population dynamics of large and small herbivorous mammals operate in two worlds that overlap only partly, and in this paper I address whether the conjecture that these worlds represent two distinct and valid paradigms is currently justified. I argue that large mammals fall into three groups depending on whether they have effective predators or not, and whether they are harvested by humans. Because of human persecution of large predators, more and more large herbivorous mammals are effectively predator-free and are controlled bottom-up by food. But in less disturbed systems, large herbivorous mammals should be controlled top-down by effective predators, and this can lead to a trophic cascade. Small herbivorous mammals have been suggested to be controlled top-down by predators but some experimental evidence has challenged this idea and replaced it with the notion that predation is one of several factors that may affect rates of population increase. Intrinsic control (territoriality, infanticide, social inhibition of breeding) appears to be common in small herbivorous mammals with altricial young but is absent in species with precocial young, in ecosystems with strong stochastic weather variation (deserts) and in areas of human-induced habitat fragmentation in agricultural monocultures. The extrinsic control of large herbivores with precocial young validates part of Graeme Caughley's Grand Vision, but the relative role of intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms for small herbivores with altricial young is still controversial. An improved knowledge of population control mechanisms for large and small herbivores is essential for natural resource management.},

abstract = {In many forested ecosystems, the architecture and functional ecology of certain tree species define forest structure and their species-specific traits control ecosystem dynamics. Such foundation tree species are declining throughout the world due to introductions and outbreaks of pests and pathogens, selective removal of individual taxa, and over-harvesting. Through a series of case studies, we show that the loss of foundation tree species changes the local environment on which a variety of other species depend; how this disrupts fundamental ecosystem processes, including rates of decomposition, nutrient fluxes, carbon sequestration, and energy flow; and dramatically alters the dynamics of associated aquatic ecosystems. Forests in which dynamics are controlled by one or a few foundation species appear to be dominated by a small number of strong interactions and may be highly susceptible to alternating between stable states following even small perturbations. The ongoing decline of many foundation species provides a set of important, albeit unfortunate, opportunities to develop the research tools, models, and metrics needed to identify foundation species, anticipate the cascade of immediate, short- and long-term changes in ecosystem structure and function that will follow from their loss, and provide options for remedial conservation and management.},

The survey used a standardised arrangement of trap type, trap spacing and two types of bait, roasted coconut and dried fish. Forty locations were surveyed, using 200 traps at each location for a total of four nights (800 trap-nights/survey site). In all, 309 individuals of 22 species of rodents were trapped using snap-traps and cage-traps. Seven species constituted 75{\%} of captures as follows: Rattus hoffmani (17.1{\%}), R. marmosurus (15.2{\%}), Bunomys chrysocomus (12.3{\%}), B. prolatus (11.6{\%}), B. penitus (9.7{\%}), Paruromys dominator (9.7{\%}) and Taeromys celebensis (8.1{\%}). Significantly more rats were captured in cage-traps (171 individuals) than snap-traps (138 individuals) and dried coconut was preferred (196 individuals) to fish as bait (113 individuals). Rodent diversity as measured by Fisher's $\alpha$ peaked in the altitude range 1200–1500 m asl and generally declined at higher elevations. However, a secondary peak above 2100 m in diversity reflected the very low and even abundance of upper montane species. Simpson's and Shannon–Weiner indices were relatively constant across all altitude categories. Among the surveyed vegetation types, rodent diversity was highest in cloud forest, upper montane forest, montane forest, lower montane moist forest, swamp forest and marsh habitats, and lowest diversity in lower montane forest, lowland forest and monsoon forest. Fisher's $\alpha$ and Simpson's diversity indices attained highest values in the Kototinggi land system and for Shannon–Weiner index in the Telawi land system.},

We present a new phylogenetic analysis of morphological characters and map these characters onto a recently published phylogenetic tree obtained from DNA sequence data. Results of these and previous analyses strongly support the monophyly of four clades of Nothofagaceae that are currently treated as subgenera of Nothofagus. The four clades of Nothofagaceae are robust and well-supported, with deep stem divergences, have evolutionary equivalence with other genera of Fagales, and can be circumscribed with morphological characters. We argue that these morphological and molecular differences are sufficient for the four clades of Nothofagaceae to be recognised at the primary rank of genus, and that this classification will be more informative and efficient than the currently circumscribed Nothofagus with four subgenera. Nothofagus is recircumscribed to include five species from southern South America, Lophozonia and Trisyngyne are reinstated, and the new genus Fuscospora is described. Fuscospora and Lophozonia, with six and seven species respectively, occur in New Zealand, southern South America and Australia. Trisyngyne comprises 25 species from New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Indonesia. New combinations are provided where necessary in each of these genera.},

abstract = {The stoat (Mustela erminea) is a specialist predator that evolved to exploit the unstable populations of northern voles and lemmings. It was introduced to New Zealand, where it is pre-adapted to respond with a population irruption to the resource pulses that follow a heavy seedfall of southern beech (Nothofagus spp.). Culling stoats during an irruption is necessary to reduce damaging predation on nesting endemic birds. Culling might not reduce the stoat population long term, however, if high natural mortality exceeds culling mortality in peak years. During other phases of the beech-mast cycle, culling might have a greater effect on a smaller stoat population, whether or not damage prevention is critical. We developed a 4-matrix model to predict the effects of culling on lambda, the annual rate of change in the size of the stoat population, through the four annual phases of an average masting cycle, explicitly distinguishing between apparent and real culling. In the Post-seedfall phase of the cycle, large numbers of stoats are killed, but little of this extra mortality is additive; in other phases, culling removes larger proportions of smaller total numbers of stoats that would otherwise have lived. Culling throughout all phases is most effective at reducing stoat populations, but is also the most expensive option. Culling in Post-seedfall plus Seed or Crash years is somewhat less effective but better than culling in one phase only. Culling has different short-term effects on stoat age distribution depending on the phase of the cycle when culling begins.},

abstract = {Predator control will be required to save many mohua (Mohoua ochrocephala) populations from extinction. However, control may be required only in years when stoat (Mustela erminea) densities are high. To manage local stoat populations effectively, a reliable predictor of high risk years is required. We examined whether different levels of beech seedfall and mouse capture rates were related to the levels of mohua predation recorded in the Hawdon Valley, Arthur's Pass National Park, and the Eglinton Valley, Fiordland National Park, between 1989 and 1994. During this period there was only one full beech mast year in each study area during autumn. The full mast seedfall in Hawdon Valley was predominantly of mountain beech (Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortioides) and red beech (N. fusca), and in Eglinton Valley it was predominantly silver beech (N. menziesii). During the following summer, mouse and stoat densities, and the predation rate of adult mohua, all increased considerably. There was very little predation on adult mohua in the summers following poor seedfalls when mouse and predator densities remained low. In 1993, a partial mast did not trigger a mouse or stoat irruption. We conclude that counts of beech seedfall and indices of mouse density are potential predictors of an impending irruption of key predators. Winter mouse density appeared to be the most reliable indicator, because neither stoats nor mice respond to seedfall alone. A combination of these indicators could be used as a basis for management decisions on whether to undertake stoat control to protect mohua populations in the future. However, more information is required on the seedfall thresholds that may trigger sufficient increases in mouse and stoat numbers and, consequently, bird predation},

abstract = {The role of predators in the decline of New Zealand forest birds, and specifically the roles of mustelids and rodents, is reviewed. Hole-nesting forest birds are particularly vulnerable to predation because they display few predator-avoidance behaviours. Mohua (Molnia ochrocephala) and parakeets are especially at risk because they nest when stoat (Mustela erminea) numbers in the forest are highest, and, because only females incubate, nest predation causes a biassed sex ratio. The Department of Conservation's hole-nesting birds and predator research programme aims to investigate three questions: (1) Are contemporary predators still having a significant impact on the long-term viability of forest bird populations? (2) Can we predict when predators will affect forest bird populations? (3) Can we increase the productivity and viability of forest bird populations by controlling predators? Mohua and yellow-crowned parakeets were used as indicator species to answer these questions, and the resulting eight studies are briefly outlined.},

abstract = {Apex predators have experienced catastrophic declines throughout the world as a result of human persecution and habitat loss. These collapses in top predator populations are commonly associated with dramatic increases in the abundance of smaller predators. Known as “mesopredator release,” this trophic interaction has been recorded across a range of communities and ecosystems. Mesopredator outbreaks often lead to declining prey populations, sometimes destabilizing communities and driving local extinctions. We present an overview of mesopredator release and illustrate how its underlying concepts can be used to improve predator management in an increasingly fragmented world. We also examine shifts in North American carnivore ranges during the past 200 years and show that 60{\%} of mesopredator ranges have expanded, whereas all apex predator ranges have contracted. The need to understand how best to predict and manage mesopredator release is urgent—mesopredator outbreaks are causing high ecological, economic, and social costs around the world.},

abstract = {Predator control will be required to save many mohua (Mohoua ochrocephala) populations from extinction. However, control may be required only in years when stoat (Mustela erminea) densities are high. To manage local stoat populations effectively, a reliable predictor of high risk years is required. We examined whether different levels of beech seedfall and mouse capture rates were related to the levels of mohua predation recorded in the Hawdon Valley, Arthur's Pass National Park, and the Eglinton Valley, Fiordland National Park, between 1989 and 1994. During this period there was only one full beech mast year in each study area during autumn. The full mast seedfall in Hawdon Valley was predominantly of mountain beech (Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortioides) and red beech (N. fusca), and in Eglinton Valley it was predominantly silver beech (N. menziesii). During the following summer, mouse and stoat densities, and the predation rate of adult mohua, all increased considerably. There was very little predation on adult mohua in the summers following poor seedfalls when mouse and predator densities remained low. In 1993, a partial mast did not trigger a mouse or stoat irruption. We conclude that counts of beech seedfall and indices of mouse density are potential predictors of an impending irruption of key predators. Winter mouse density appeared to be the most reliable indicator, because neither stoats nor mice respond to seedfall alone. A combination of these indicators could be used as a basis for management decisions on whether to undertake stoat control to protect mohua populations in the future. However, more information is required on the seedfall thresholds that may trigger sufficient increases in mouse and stoat numbers and, consequently, bird predation},

My goal is to reach those with little or no training in higher level statistics so that they can do more of their own data analysis, communicate more with statisticians, and appreciate the great potential statistics has to offer as a tool to answer biological questions. This is necessary in light of the increasing use of higher level statistics in biomedical research. I hope it accomplishes this mission and encourage its free distribution and use as a course text or supplement.

abstract = {The introduction of some animal and plant pest species in New Zealand has facilitated the establishment and success of other introduced pest species. Classic examples include rodents and rabbits, which have provided prey for a number of introduced mammalian predator species. Control of these introduced predators in New Zealand has historically focussed on removing them directly by lethal means. This approach suffers from density-dependent population responses that accelerate population recovery at low population densities. I suggest adopting an ecologically-based approach to pest control that breaks the interactive linkages between invasive mammalian pests at high trophic levels and the other introduced species that they rely on as their primary food resource. Some of these primary food species are, in turn, affected by land management practices and land-use policy. Removing the primary food resource for introduced pests at high trophic levels should, in theory, weaken the density-dependent responses that reduce the impact of lethal control. This 'bottom-up' form of pest control has the added advantage of reducing pest impacts at lower trophic levels. A greater emphasis on bottom-up pest management that targets lower trophic levels could greatly enhance current tactical approaches that focus directly on pests at higher trophic levels. Examples of where this approach could assist management of introduced pests in New Zealand and overseas are discussed.},

abstract = {The population dynamics of ship rats (Rattus rattus L.) were studied in podocarp/hardwood and hard beech (Nothofagus truncata) forest in the Orongorongo Valley, near Wellington, from 1971 to 1998. Rat density (indexed by captures in 116 snap traps over 3 nights per quarter) varied up to five-fold between consecutive years. Fruiting of hinau (Elaeocarpus dentatus) and hard beech did not drive the fluctuations as had been suggested. Average density increased over the first 15 years of the study (from 2.3 {\^{A}}± 0.3 to 7.5 {\^{A}}± 0.8 per 100 trap-nights (mean {\^{A}}± SE)), and then declined; this mirrored a trend in cat density driven by external factors. Breeding was largely restricted to spring (November) and summer (February). Breeding rate (proportion pregnant or lactating) was density-dependent, particularly in older rats. Litter size (based on live embryos and new uterine scars) increased between spring (4.4 {\^{A}}± 0.4) and summer (5.5 {\^{A}}± 0.3) (mean {\^{A}}± SE), but did not vary with density or age. Winter breeding was rare (2{\%} pregnant or lactating in August). Hinau fruitfall did not predict the proportion breeding in autumn (May), or survival in winter-spring (i.e., population change between August and November). Varying predation intensity was the most likely explanation for the population trend. We review other New Zealand studies and question the assumption that ship rat populations are "eruptive", except possibly when predation is eliminated. {\^{A}}{\textcopyright} The Royal Society of New Zealand 2006.},
